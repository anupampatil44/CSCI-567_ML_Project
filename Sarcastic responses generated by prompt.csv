I can't believe you would be so insensitive to his distress, smh.","TIFU by pretending to be a mannequin Like so many others this didn't happen yesterday, but a few years ago when I was in college. I was working in a sunglass and lifestyle store when I got bored and decided to cover myself from head to toe in snowboarding gear. All the way from pants and jacket to gloves, facemask, goggles and hat. Not a single piece of skin was showing. I goofed off in the store for a bit and then decided to go stand in the big glass front window. This is where the FU happens. I am standing in there as still as can be and getting a couple of weird looks but nothing too strange. For the most part people aren't noticing me. Then a little kid (maybe 12 years old) comes right up to the glass and stares at me, obviously noticing something isn't right. That's when the practical joker in me takes over and I throw my hands up and scare the crap out of the little bugger. He runs off half scared half laughing and I leave the window display and get back to actually working. A few minutes later an older fellow comes in and says he saw what I did and that it was incredibly racist...ohh, I didn't mention that the little kid was black, because to a normal person they wouldn't even think in those terms. The older fellow was black too. He goes on to tell me that he's a professor at one of the Ivy League colleges across town and that he studies this kind of stuff regularly and that what I did was incredibly racist. He lectured me a bit more, and I just stood there and listened since I was so caught off guard then he finished by saying that it was because of people like me doing that kind of stuff that black people were afraid of white people. TLDR: pretended to be a mannequin. Scared a little kid who happened to be black. Got called a racist.","Well, nothing quite makes your day like being called insensitive for pretending to be a mannequin and startling a 12-year-old black child. It's heartwarming to know that by doing something as innocent as that, you've successfully added to the fear of white people in his little heart. Kudos to you for your impeccable racist intentions."

74,But separating and demonizing people different then you has had such positive benefits in the past.,"This summer I went to an Asian festival. There were people there from all different Asian cultures sharing food, info, etc. There was a tent set up with a table for each Asian culture to share history and info to visitors. I went to support a friend who was competing in the dragon boat race but enjoyed the food and stuff as well. I do hoop dance so I brought my hoop with me and a bunch of old Asian men and women commented that they lived my Totoro rights, and the guys running that culture/info tent made me dance and share my dancing with them. It was great fun and I can't wait to go again next year. I posted about it on fb to a hooping group and got shit on about how I dont belong there and I was appropriating their culture and that the festival was made for people of color, not whites. So it's okay for Spanish and black people to go to learn, but not whites. Fuck that girl. I had a custard bun and faced to kpop. When I mention that I was excited that I heard music being played from Korea that I knew and loved (I love kpop, fight me), the girl on fb lost her shit. People like that drive me crazy. White people get so upset while the people actually a part of these cultures want nothing more than to share with us. :'(","Oh, wow.

In fact, maybe the next festival should be called 'The White Girl Appropriation Celebration'. Great fun for all!"
75,"Yeah, how dare she stick up for herself.","Seriously if she wanted to keep out of the spotlight, this was the opposite of what she would want to do. An open letter screams for media attention.","Oh, absolutely, she should've just sat there holding her tongue as those jerks walked all over her. Really showing everyone the power of back-stabbing anonymity in today's connected world."
76,Of course we love lazy customers without them we would have nothing to do,Funny Lazy People Long time lurker here I was working in the frozen dept. minding my own business fixing plugging issues and decided to take a box back so it doesn't thaw out on my way back i see a customer put what looks to be a purse on a rack where it doesn't belong and she seen me look at her this is what she said Customer:Yea i'm lazy I don't want to go back to the other side its your job to put it back and you love me for it me: .....

Child rape comes close, but they could probably still find away to excuse it away...","1. ""Oh, child rape? Well, at least it wasn't abortion. Just kidding, I'm sure they'd find a way to defend that too!""
2. ""You know, I was joking about infanticide, but real talk, I bet they'd still make excuses for that. What a fantasy world we live in!"""
78,"Oh, well in that case... Make fun of him all you want!",I don't think that comment was making fun of Vasilli's speech.,"Oh, well in that case... How can I possibly resist the irresistible opportunity to make fun of Vasilli's speech? The world needs more laughter, right?"

82,It's a metaphorical *physical* wall,"Well, I mean, we're discussing Trump's ""policies"". Immigration is probably the issue he's talked about most. His website documents a 10-point plan for immigration. The wall is the first of those ten points, and it literally says he plans to build an *impenetrable physical wall*.","1. So, you're saying that a metaphorical physical wall is exactly what we need to solve all our problems? Maybe you should invent a time machine as well!

I'm in an apartment with shitty copper, get 6/1mbps at best. About 300m away from my apartment in the rich suburbs of Ascot and Hamilton with their million dollar plus houses they were some of the first to get FTTP rolled out, but us plebs over in the cheaper higher density suburbs closer to the city?

There isn't a point ganking anywhere else, if your bot lane gets crushed, your towers and objectives go to the enemy team.","Oh, absolutely!

93,"Well, she IS a part of Eddie's legacy.","Considering Sasha took the most brutal bumps in the match I'm not sure how scared WWE was for Sasha. 3 table spots, a sidewalk slam into a chair and a monkey flip into the cage wasn't enough? Did he want her to die in the match?","Oh wow, hailing someone as part of Eddie's legacy is such an admirable thing. Just because she took the heaviest hits and this wasn't a poor attempt to make her famous through Hail Mary tactics? Phew, we're all so relieved the WWE care so little about Sasha's well-being."
94,"You're right, they'd have voted Trump.","If Bernie had won, then Bloomberg would have likely joined the race and split out the moderate Dems. Sorry, but there are tons of lifelong Dem voters who would never have gotten on board with a candidate who openly praised Castro.","Yeah, because everyone knows Bloomberg is the perfect representative of moderate Democrats.

96,Maybe it's the Whigs.,I wonder which campaign they are linked to?,"You're right, because the Whigs were known for their immense success in political campaigns. We should probably invoke their ghosts to help us win the next election."
97,"Yea, but MAGA so who cares!",It would ravage the WA economy and even do some fair harm to SC.,"Oh, I'm sure the people in Washington and South Carolina would just love to have their economies destroyed and lives turned upside down, as long as it fits with your simplistic ""MAGA"" agenda!

Melania heading to suburban Philly will surely resonate with everyday American women, because let's face it, struggling to relate to billionaires is so commonplace.

105,Who is Mike Huckleberry?,Oh boy Mike Huckabee already up and insulting Kaine. Calling him a chihuahua. I don't know why Huckabee is even relevant anymore.

106,Greek,What pantheon do you want to see more of? I really want to see more for the Hindu. They've been out for so long and hardly have any characters to play compared to the Greek. Super excited for the one they're making next year. Hope they expand all of them and leave the Greek alone for a little after Nike and bulk up the rest.,"Oh wow, how ingenious! It's completely brilliant to perpetuate the same formula of Greek mythology and completely neglect the countless other fascinating pantheons!

That means 90% of spots were available to ORM:white students. Just declare your race and earn what you get. I applied as white and I've had absolutely no problems. Your race isn't stopping you.","1. Ah, yes, white privilege. It's just like all those doors magically opening and opportunities falling from the sky. I'm so desperate for this attention.

117,"well if you aren't rich and white, it's obviously your fault and you're lazy.","Of course they did. It also came out that they have been explicitly targeting the black population for denial of voting rights. The Republican Party is deeply, deeply racist and steeped in the idea that the only votes that should really count are rich white conservatives. That's why they're so upset by ""those people"" voting in the inner cities.","Oh wow, it's like discovering that cotton grows in fields, not on trees! The Republicans must be so confused seeing brown skin people exercising their right to vote. Don't worry though, they'll soon learn that people with melanin also have fingers to press buttons."
118,"BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT EVERYONE KNOWS THE STATUS OF YOUR SEXUALITY, GENDER, RACE, IDENTITY REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF PERSON YOU ARE DUH","If I have sons I won't be circumcizing them, but I don't see why you'd announce the status of your son's dick to the world.","Oh, absolutely. It's crucial to tell everyone about your son's anatomy, especially since they were clearly asking for an update.

121,You could always pay it back in tithe or consider the thousands you've already given for maintenance of facilities.,That's destruction of others' property. Not cool.,"1. Oh yeah, because paying a percentage to a higher power for their blessing will totally prevent my desire to engage in petty vandalism.
2. If the thousands I've already gifted for facility upkeep weren't enough, I suppose I'll have to reshuffle my investments to accommodate the divine tithe."
122,Almost no parenting needed!,That's the best part about our generation. We have the internet and youtube videos to help us with almost anything.,"""Oh, fabulous! We don't have to actually parent anymore, just watch a YouTube tutorial on 'How to be a Good Parent' while our kids ignore us on their tablets.""

133,But too many characters,"It really is a shame that they killed The Other so off-handedly. I get that he wasn't exactly much of a vivid character, but it would have been nice for him to keep serving as an extended presence for Thanos throughout the rest of the road to Infinity War. Not to mention seeing Whedon's fingerprints on the MCU carry forward even after his departure would've been cool :)","Oh, absolutely! It's not like we needed any more characters in this already over-packed universe, and surely nobody would have noticed if Whedon's mark faded away into oblivion.

Came home from work the next day to find a hobo passed out on the back porch. Called the police; they came by, got him to wake up, and moved him along. The officer implied that it was basically my fault for not having a fence. I didn't think that was a fair assessment of the situation, and I still disagree with her. Society functions because we have rules, and I feel that if one class of citizens is given a pass to break those rules (i.e. Hale's homeless policies or the recent verdict in the Malheur case), a dangerous precedent is established.","""Oh, I'm sure the hobo appreciated my thoughtful offer to build his hotel.

The cars were torched, sure, but we don't know if the anti-Semitic stuff was meant to be taken *hatefully*.","Oh, absolutely, it's just a joke.

For example, you have a cannon in center, and your opponent puts MiniPekka. Pewpewpew, and one-shot MP comes to cannon. It should fire to save its live, BUT! Archer tower already sent an arrow, and cannon thinks ""Mmm, MP is going to die from this arrow, (and i am so lazy), i wouldn't shoot"". Arrow velocity is pretty slow, and when it comes to target, MP already cut down that cannon. And during the arrow's flight there was enough time for cannon to shoot and kill that damn MP. But it refuse. Does it annoy only me or there are somebody else?","Oh, absolutely, the cannon is just trying to save ammo, bro. The gravity-defying MiniPekka is so terrifying that the cannon decides to embrace its laziness and simply hopes for the arrow to hit the target. Totally not frustrating or annoying at all."
147,"People don't learn anything about getting away with crimes while they're in prison, do they?",Yeah it's almost as if the person that used it to kill Teresa wiped it down to remove the fingerprints and DNA. Because murderers tend to do that when they don't want to be connected to a murder weapon. I wonder who learned an awful lot about DNA after being exonerated because of it...,"Oh, absolutely not!

As a new employee, the company will issue you the standard computer, 8GB flash drive, along with employee handbook, etc. etc. He refused the flash drive because the size was too small (physically) and he believed it won't have any storage capacity. * So he kept having to borrow my flash drive. He also didn't know how to plug it into his computer and kept complaining that the flash drive is ""broken"". * We're an international company with offices in many countries. So, it goes without saying that we all communicate through email. He drafts EVERY EMAIL (even simple replies) on PAPER and then asks me to proof read it before he sends it out. He works as a COPYWRITER. * He asked me if the ""SEND"" button in Outlook means that his email was sent out. * He has more than once got scammed by those Nigerian Prince emails. He sends them his password when they ask for it. * He likes to google my full name (it's not a common name at all. Only I have it.). He googles it often enough that it pops up every time he types in the first letter of my name on Google. One day, he got so excited and showed it to me because I was ""FAMOUS"" because Google knows my name. * Each month, the housekeeper would walk around and issue out tissue paper to put at our workstation. The first time, he asked me what it was. * He drives the cleaning ladies insane by going into the pantry, use plates and mugs and put them back in the cupboard without washing them. When confronted, his argument was that he'll use it again eventually. * He likes to listen in on conversations. More than once, he would ask me what people in five workstations away were talking about. * He stares at people. ALL. THE. TIME. And stare at your computer screen and comment on what you're working on. * He didn't know how to put staples in staplers. When I helped him with it, his reply: ""Thank you so much. I'm just not used to these new technologies."" * He constantly asks people how much their salary is. * His probation period was extended (understandably. he was still asking me to proofread his emails). When HR told him, he threw a tantrum claiming that they can't do that because he already told his mom that he passed the probation. * He often takes his copywriting work home for his mom to check. This is what I can think of from the top of my head. I'm know there's more as he drove me nuts to the point that I wanted to quit and the Head of HR had to console me. I was his designated babysitter for the duration of his time there. People still joke that one day he might come into the office and shoot everyone. I would be the first to go.","Oh, wow. You should really consider nominating Kevin for the 'Unsung Hero' award. I mean, who wouldn't want a proofreader and personal assistant in their life? And let's not forget his impressive Nigerian Prince scam-fending skills. Truly a Renaissance man!"

162,I think its normal that I have to equip my 850 ring instead of Sephuz's secret.,"If Sephuz's Secret and Prydaz were hot fixed to include primary stats, it would help to soften the disappointment players are feeling when they receive these items. Thoughts? They mentioned in a recent Dev Q and A they were looking to buff some of the weaker legendary items. Without a rework on these items i doubt the majority of the player base will ever feel satisfied when they receive a legendary that is in some cases a DPS loss.","Oh absolutely, it's completely reasonable for someone to have to boost their 850 ring over a legendary item like Sephuz's Secret ‚Äì that way everyone can experience the joy of losing DPS because the game needs more challenges, right? Who needs satisfaction when they finally find a good legendary? Everybody loves that sinking feeling, don't they?"

Why not keep it as an exclusive item for being active in the community (giveaways and tourneys)? When we first saw the mount, the first tought was ""ok ill try to get this EA exclusive item so i can show off like 1 year from here"". Well, no. Doing this removes the credibility of the item and unmotivates people to work to get them. This is honestly stupid.","1. ""Oh wow, having to spend hundreds on chests for the Molten Warhound? Now that's an unbeatable value and a great way to keep people motivated. Genius!""

It's not difficult and only takes one day or some instructors spread it out over two weeknights. I'm in full support of requiring that anyone purchasing a handgun be required to prove that they have some sort of formal training.","Oh wow, because we all know the NRA is just some random organization with no expertise in anything.

217,Reported for spam.,"There should be a ""casual mode"" added to the game Most games have a ranked mode and casual mode, where your rank doesn't matter and you just play against people for fun. Since Clash Royale has become pretty competitive in it's life time, I think it would be a great idea to add something like casual mode. Right now you can only play ladder, tournies and challenges. Two of which need gems to be played (or you join a free tourny, but it's incredibly difficult to find one these days). Ladder is great and all, but you get frustrated really quick, so I don't see a reason why a casual mode shouldn't be added.","You're reporting for spam because you disagree with someone's idea for a casual mode in a game?

Redditors are definitely known for their calm demeanor, keen sense of logic, and infinite patience while sifting through a flood of unverified hot takes. It's just their thing."
227,But doctors are paid by big pharma to make us spend money on bike helmets.,"Tell that to my father, who was thrown from his bike and landed so hard his helmet was cracked in half. Or maybe my boyfriend, who was in a hit and run that left him in the hospital for months. According to the doctors, neither of them would've survived if they hadn't been wearing helmets.","1. Oh, let me update my calendar, the day when doctors' top priority shifts from saving lives to promoting big pharma.

They believe Obama and Hillary are out to destroy the country, one health insurance registration and common-sense tax policy at a time.","1. ""Oh great, it's the Russians again! First they hacked our elections and now they're criticizing the right-wing's healthcare and tax policies. No wonder we're all Russia apologists.""

232,Gotta look like I'm payin my child support,black people who smoke: why is it always menthols?,"1. Oh, absolutely, nothing says ""responsible parent"" like drowning your sorrows in a packet of menthols, followed by a healthy dose of child support evasion.
2. Well, considering we're discussing black people and menthols, I guess Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. must've been on a Lucky Strike kick in his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech."

236,Had to check post history to see if,"Why is no one talking about how Bill raped and email in Benghazi, and gave it Parkinson's disease. The email couldn't keep the affair (c)ondential, so Hillary sacrificed her in a blood ritual to Satan. And then declared war on the canned foods section at a grocery store to take out the pickle jar who was going to leak the story.","Oh, absolutely, I was going to mention that, but I was browsing your post history first to make sure you're not a CIA agent or something. Because, you know, people only make up stuff like this."

249,"sure - for n girls, just approach n-1",Just don't be the guy at gerts yesterday who went up to every single girl sequentially asking to join.,"You must be mistaken, I'm pretty sure that's the walk of fame, not a social strategy. I mean, gaining popularity one star at a time, genius."
250,But but he throws deep!,that's two weeks in a row Foles has missed a wide open receiver on a sure TD. Although I don't think there's really going to be a big QB controversy among the fans after this week anyway.,"1. ""Oh, what a game-changer! After all, it's not every day you see a QB throw deep and still not make the terrible wide-open pass.""
2. ""Amazing! A prodigious QB like Foles consistently missing wide open receivers, yet, fans still can't seem to start a controversy."""
251,It worked when Wentz was in college it must work in the NFL!,What the fuck in the game tape told doug that QB draws were going to work? And why does he keep trying it even after it gets fucked each time?,"1. Oh, it's a miracle! The genius 'game tape' finally broke the code to take college success directly to the NFL. Must be the secret to his career longevity.

If we're talking about real talent, maybe we should have a contest of who can throw the most predictable smokes."
256,He's not used to losing,"I've realized that too, you used to see him pissed when the camera would pan to him after a penalty or a blown play. Now he just seems off.","Oh, that poor soul!

261,dude its a metaphor,can someone site where the 650000 number came from?,"You do realize that ""650000"" is just a metaphor for ""a really, really big number,"" right? Good luck verifying that."
262,"And by posting this speculation on Reddit, you've blown the operation out of the water because all Jihadis use Reddit...","I wonder why they even announce plans like this to the public. I'm guessing it's because the operation has been underway for awhile, but they haven't seen much movement from the targets. So they're playing mind games.","Oh, absolutely, nothing says ""we're about to strike"" like announcing your grand plans on Reddit, clockwork logic there."
263,Leafs are so *mainstream*,It's because we overshadow them. Being a huge city with arguably the biggest Canadian team makes them feel inadequate. It's cool to hate something popular,"Oh, totally! The Leafs, just an insignificant speck in the massive shadow of this mega-city. Who wouldn't want to be overshadowed like that? It's like being the side character in your own life, what could be more relatable?"

274,You are clearly well informed about german politics,To be honest she has slightly less chance of getting reelected than a snowflake has in a blast furnace.,"Oh, absolutely.

280,Because fuck the ARG,"It was quite clear to be honest. All the theories people had etc had her doing some hacking on players. I was even discussing it in the discord and said about a hack that disables other abilities.

285,Because Collins is supposed to single handedly make our defense unbeatable after one week of practice,"Coleman, Ogbah, Nassib, and Kessler have all looked like solid picks. How can anyone see the Collins trade as bad? In the absolute worst case scenario it's a wash. Isn't Wentz starting to look pretty bad sometimes? Hiring the top HC candidate. When's the last time that has happened here? Just my off the head things that I believe the regime has done right.","Oh wow, I never knew that Collins was going to single-handedly cure cancer and win Super Bowls for your team.

Well, I stand corrected, your tattoo is obviously just a rugged piece of steel and circuitry."
295,"Darn, there goes my hope of a superhuman version of me.","Except not. While 'any idiot' can learn the basics, and even order custom printed genetic material, actually getting it into a living organism (and one capable of spreading the trait in reproduction) is absolutely NOT something you'll be doing in your dining room.","Oh, what a shame, my dreams of becoming a genetics wizard in my kitchen have been crushed. Just when I thought the fine art of DIY genetics was as simple as cooking Ramen."

299,"Hey, it's fine as long as it's **me** at the top.",This is like business owners who don't think workers deserve a living wage because they didn't work hard and start a business. If 90% of workers took thier advice and started a business no one would be left to work for anyone. So their sytem requires that most people be a worker but they don't deserve a living because they don't start a business...,"1. ""Well, that's just swell.

And it's designed to fit comfortably at the current aspect ratio with the friends list basically sitting to the side of it. To get super real with y'all, we've had a few people saying this whenever they get access to the alpha, but we think it's mostly just because it's a change from the legacy client, and we're expecting it to die down on its own.

They're both teenagers, one awkward dude and a pretty, attractive girl. I stand there waiting and the guy looks over, sees me, and then turns to continue talking to the girl. I am not really the kind of person to say ""excuse me!"" so I just stood there. I was waiting long enough to get my phone out and text my friend about the situation. So dude's really working it, trying to be funny. All the while she's occupying herself with some task and laughing politely. Dude is laughing hard at his own jokes and straight up ignoring me. Finally the girl sees me and nods in my direction, telling dude to go do his job. When he walks up, I am really pissed off. I'm not really in the business of confronting strangers, but this one bothered me more than usual. So I say loudly, ""hey, glad you could take a break from trying to bang your coworker to take my order."" At this, dude looks quickly to the girl and she visibly recoils and says, ""ugh, what?"" Dude tries to recover, saying he didn't notice me standing there, but the damage had been done. He looked defeated, girl looked extremely uncomfortable, and now I'm eating in the corner watching them actively ignore each other and pretend the other doesn't exist. Enjoy the rest of your shift, awkward teenage boy. Also, sorry about the collateral damage, teenage girl.","Oh dear, it must have been absolutely devastating for you to be ignored and create a palpable atmosphere of awkwardness.

If you want a fast experience, comparable to a modern flagship, is a Snapdragon 800 and stock Android. Nexus 5 fits this perfectly. For the minimum usable, I'd say Snapdragon S4 Pro, aka the Nexus 7 2013. This is noticeably slower with some lag, but not enough to really slow you down. Loading up more intense websites can be a pain. Feels like a budget device. So, what are your thoughts on this?","Oh, wow! I'm just blown away by your dedication to packing your daily device with maximum laggy performance.

Honestly just let people form their own ideas even if they seem ridiculous. Their crazy ideas aren't hurting you. It seems that with social media everybody is quick to calling each other a *somethingist* and tell others how wrong they are. So what if they're wrong? and so what if someone doesn't believe what you do?

Man, I can't wait to see who will be the ultimate champion of this year's ""I'm right, you're wrong"" competition.

458,But but but then sniper riffles would be actually good at something and no no no snipers are not allowed to be so.,"Armor really needs a complete rework (alongside many other things...) to be something more than just a multiplicative damage modifier. I've always personally been a fan of armor acting as a damage subtraction modifier instead (essentially making high armor targets impervious to high rate of fire low damage weapons), since it at least is different, whereas the current system could be entirely eliminated in favor of just more base health. Then you can have armor *penetration*, which reduces how effective armor is at subtracting your damage, and a flat health type modifier which multiplies your damage according to its type. If you want a more involved system, just make armor its own health bar like shields, and make certain damage types reduce it over time. Damage type modifiers would affect armor health and enemy health separately, so you don't deal +1000% damage because the enemy has 1 armor point left.","Well, that's truly a groundbreaking idea to just eliminate armor entirely and replace it with basic health.

Because it seems to have fallen out while trying to make a point.

629,DAE think not liking racism makes you the real racist tho?,"I'm sorry, but there's nothing wrong with being intolerant of people's intolerance.","1. ""Oh, thank you for enlightening me on the fact that standing against prejudice actually makes you the true bigot. I guess I'll go burn some crosses now.""

630,But how does that justify Sanders telling his supporters they should riot in the streets?,"That's not what he fucking said; he reminded the reporter about the First Amendment, said he understands why people are protesting and summarized what he believes to be their message. If the media wants to restore the tatters of what reputation it has left it needs to stop putting words in peoples' mouths.","Oh, so now we're blaming the media for people's temper tantrums? It's possible that Sanders' supporters might just be, y'know, upset about losing an election."
631,Because civil disobedience isn't a thing and it would be sooooo much work to convince people to not pay their federal taxes.,"thats not how income tax works, federal funding works exactly how I describe it. Explain to me how you are going to get CEO's to break federal law.","Oh, absolutely! Just stop talking now, because clearly you're an expert on taxation and federal laws. Better yet, you go ahead and tell all the CEOs to break federal laws, we'll enjoy the spectacle from a safe distance."

Having a shadow priest I know they are the most unforgiving so exlude them.,"""Oh, definitely Ret Paladin! Those guys must have a lot of free time to master that super challenging class.""

""You mean besides the Shadow Priests you just excluded? Because I'm sure they're sweating bullets, trying to get the hang of their insanely difficult abilities."""
634,"Ohh no didn't you know, it's just like the civil rights movement and Donald Trump is the same as Hitler.",Raging progressive here: PC culture is poisonous. Its main function is to suppress speech and thought. It's as poisonous as racism.,"Oh, fantastic! Everything gets compared to the Holocaust these days. Nothing quite says ""I've got a point"" like bringing up Hitler."
635,Yes but was he abused and attacked by someone from a position of privilege?,"He was called ""one of those white boy trump supporters"" by the attacker. Linked by op above.","1. Oh, well that completely changes everything. If it wasn't for the white boy Trump supporter's position of privilege, he never would've been attacked. Debatable improvement to society, right? 

2. Oh, boohoo, suck it up! How dare you suffer at the hands of someone less privileged than a white boy Trump supporter. Now you know how the rest of us feel every day. Good riddance."
636,Yeah they definitely didn't learn a hard lesson.,"Hillary Clinton was reportedly going to be crowned queen, too. The entire media establishment was insanely wrong about everything this election, but sure, let's all continue to give them our blind faith and trust.","1. Oh, they really taught those media geniuses a tough lesson! Now they'll definitely get their facts right next time. 
2. Well, the media must have taken those harsh consequences to heart. They're probably reevaluating their entire approach now."

642,We're gonna be pray'n for ya!,"Maybe they can pray to Jesus that money will just magically appear to cover the costs to taxpayers and the moral degeneracy and anger that it causes when we have to pay for these mistakes. Of course they want to prevent it by infecting our brains with the notion of gods and they think it'll fix things. Been there, it didn't fix anything, it just made me a worse person. Society would be much better if we turned to rationalism.","Well, bless their hearts for trying to invoke a higher power to fix the mess they've made. If only prayer could cure ignorance and bad policy-making, we'd all be enlightened by now. Or at least less taxed."
643,"Maby she's just, liek, very considerate of the pillaging of, liek, the continent of Hawai?","Diamond head is a great hike, from the top you can see Waikiki beach aswell as a huge chunk of Honolulu. The hike itself isn't too hard thousands of regular people do it every year, would of been a real shame to miss out on the beauty Hawaii has to offer.","Oh, absolutely. She's just like, sooooooo considerate of the theft of...the shores of Honolulu, right? It really puts the ""aloha"" in ""welcome to the beach, dude."" I mean, who wouldn't want to miss out on that?"

647,"Good point, lets not do everything we can to prevent an abundance of drugs in our communities and we should instead be enriching criminal organizations in Mexico.","Legalize it for clinical research so we can cut the problem off at it's roots, stop prescribing opiates as pain medication for a toothache, stop treating people who are sick with an addiction problem like they are criminals. Increasing border security is not a solution to this issue. They will always find a way, else the dealers will find a new supplier to match their needs.","Suddenly, reigning in criminal organizations is just too mainstream. Why not let them thrive while we prioritize toothache patients getting high, innovating a whole new generation of pain-killer addicts? Sigh... personifying borders as Houdini escapists makes for such fascinating political theater."
648,*economic anxiety*,"I can't comprehend how there can be any Trump voters left that see this and don't say ""oh shit, we fucked up, we fucked up bad.""","Ah, economic anxiety. You know, the force that makes people go, ""Hey, maybe letting a reality TV star run the country wasn't the brightest idea."""
649,Ah yes: the free market will sort it out!,"Unions are a good thing, but so is right to work. It's unconstitutional to force someone to join a union.

2. Thanks for enlightening us on the genius nuances of originality in the gaming world - I can't wait to bask in the glow of your insight."
652,"But you just talked about it here, that's TOTALLY breaking your silence","For me, silence is key. Vocalizing your intentions or feelings or anything opens up alternate paths for redundancies and fuck-ups. I know my desired effect, I know how to achieve it, I know there must be sacrifice. There is nothing else. Speaking aloud simply opens too many doors. I want to be like lightning. Find the quickest, most powerful path to my desired intention. In this way mistakes usually turn out to be wonderful lessons as long as you remember there is ALWAYS sacrifice involved in all endeavors. I enjoy the popular notion that you should do good deeds anonymously. Without expectation of reward. Do it for the hell of it. Just do it and walk away. Anything more cheapens the deed.","Oh, absolutely. The power of words can turn a simple act into a grandiose event, don't you know? Just waiting to be applauded. ""Look at me, I'm talking!"" Bow before my wisdom."
653,Because how good you are at your sport dictates how important your opinion is,I hope that is sarcasm. Kaep has never been as dominant in his sport or charismatic as Ali was. People respected Ali even if they didn't like him because he backed it up.,"Oh wow, I didn't realize that Ali's opinion on literally anything was considered valuable just because he could punch really hard. That's a groundbreaking revelation."

659,Giuliani actually does have some foreign experience -- he runs a private security consulting firm that counts foreign governments among its clients including Qatar (you may remember them from that time that Trump said Hillary condones beheading gays because her charity accepted money from Muslim countries) *totally* not a conflict of interest.,"Giuliani has no international relations experience at all. Maybe you could have said the same thing about Hillary in 2008 but at least she'd been in the Senate. I'd say Corker is the best choice. It also opens his Senate seat in 2018, which would increase the chance of the Democrats taking it in the midterms (though the chance would still be tiny.)","Congratulations, you just unveiled the secret formula for world peace. We should all be in awe of your international relations expertise. It's crystal clear that nobody else on the planet holds a candle to your profound wisdom."
660,"Dude, those are all false flags, because Trump doesn't have any supporters who are racists and/or nazis.",So we should join the Trumpies and spray swastikas everywhere?,"1. Oh wow, the Irony of saying Trump has no racists supporters whilst suggesting to spray swastikas all over the place. That's like saying 'I never lie!' while telling a blatant falsehood. Truly remarkable.
2. Wait, are you advocating for a Nazi-Trump supporter union? Great, because I'm all about bringing people together. Kind of the way Hitler did with his goons, right? Aww, isn't it beautiful when the love transcends centuries and political ideologies?"

If only Climate Change was as easy to blame as China's economy."
667,"Ah yes, perfectly ok to assault someone over words","It's an insult. Doesn't matter what the insult is, you run the risk of getting an ass whoppin' if you go around insulting people. It turns out, people in a blind rage aren't open to participating in a philosophical discourse around why archaic terms are still considered insulting, and will punch you in the face without considering the logical consistency of your arguments, or even giving you the opportunity to present them.","""Well, isn't that just the epitome of intellectual discourse? We should all just accept any ridiculous term being hurled our way, as long as we're prepared to take a punch to the face.""

Honestly, in my experience and that of my friends, I have found this to be true of guys who are...overly gentlemanly? And it can be hard to identify. But if a guy, say, pays for dinner, offer to buy a post-dinner cocktail or a dessert or something, or say you'll get the next date. One way to tell if a guy was just buying you dinner to be nice or bc he was the one to ask you out, or because he thinks The Man Always Buys Dinner.","You perturb me.

677,Targeting first time home buyers eighteen months in advance of the election seems like a great way to ensure a large amount of votes.,"I think the fact that we are about 18 months from an election and the current government's approval rate is not so great, might have some influence too.","Oh, absolutely!

790,And steak was originally food for poor people because they marinated it in chamber pots for a week before cooking it for 10 hours because they were scared that the bovine ghosts would come for their revenge,"Pizza, by origin, was a way for bakers to clean the ash from the bottom of their (traditionally) wood ovens. Toppings consisted of any ingredients (usually going bad, or something that wouldn't last the night) that could weigh the dough down so it didn't bubble up too much in the oven, which would have rendered the cleaning process less effective. The result was given away to the poor or sold at a very low price. By their nature, pizza toppings can be anything that weighs down the pizza dough and is somewhat edible.","Oh wow, I had no idea that steak was just a poor man's meal designed to appease the wrath of vengeful cow spirits. And here I thought it was just a juicy, delicious cut of meat. Pizza, on the other hand, was clearly a humanitarian masterpiece created to feed the needy with their mysterious blend of edibles and ash leftovers from the bottom of the oven. Just amazing how these humble beginnings led to such gastronomic glory."
791,Yeah the police definitely would not DNA and fingerprint a random kg of coke if they found it lol,"you could just go for a drive somewhere you KNOW there are no cameras and throw it out the window, let it be someone else's problem","Oh, absolutely!

805,"If you're not doing anything wrong, you have nothing to worry about","Britain just passed the ""most extreme surveillance law ever passed in a democracy""","Oh, that's fascinating!

We're of Chinese ethnicity if you were guessing by my username.","Well, we certainly have a genius-level thinker on our hands here. I'm so impressed, I might have to write a book about it."
824,"See, a prod deshbhakt is now asking for a source on rindia.",Can you provide some sources for your numbers?,"1. Oh, a request for sources from a die-hard patriot? That's like asking the Titanic to give out swimming lessons.

825,Nothing to do with anything.,"Yep, but (((their))) thought-process doesn't work that way goys... They think ""we're God-chose, we're the Light unto the Nations, and besides that, the Torah says we will be persecuted throughout history, so it's expected that the goys will persecute us! When they persecute us, this means the Torah is getting fulilled and it also helps us to consolidate our tribe and not assimilate among them. Also, these idolatarian Christian Goys with reddish faces and hairs are the descendants of Edom(=red), and our Rabbi says that they're kind of like animals, barely human, and just like the wild animals don't like to have masters, these goys alike don't like to have masters! But as the Torah says, we will be masters and we will give a lot of loans to other nations, but we will take no loan. Also, the descendants o Jacob (=Jews) will destroy the descendants of Edom (=Christians) just like it's written in the Torah, and the Torah is what we repeat every day and on each prayer, so this belief is deeply embedded into our subconsciousness...""","Oh, absolutely, that makes perfect sense. It's not like they're trying to rationalize or justify their behavior based on a centuries-old text that requires a masterclass in interpretive dance to decipher. Nope, nothing to do with anything at all."
826,"You mean women, not people.","So, people who aren't able or willing to parent shouldn't be allowed to have sex?","Oh, of course! Because nothing says ""promoting responsible parenting"" quite like forcing people into it against their will. /sarcasm"

No one could've seen that coming.","1. Wow, who would've thought that GGG's expertise in crafting overly-powered skill gems could also extend to really standing out? It's like we're witnessing a skill-gems Miracle on Ice situation here!

Get your shit together, individual American citizens. Then you can make better choices.","Oh, for sure, it's all Putin's fault.

It's essential works to a building that draws in 500k tourists a year and is a big part of British history.","Oh, I'm sure the crown jewels just love being surrounded by ageing infrastructure and fire hazards. It's not like they're worth anything to the nation or anything."
833,Of predation?,Nah. They have a symbiotic relationship.,"Oh, great! Because nothing says ""teamwork"" like one species eating another's lunch, all while we're pretending it's some kind of Hallmark connection."

Goodness knows, we don't want you digging up any inconvenient facts here."
838,"If the members didn't clean toilets, where would the church get the $40 million/year to spend on humanitarian efforts?","Yep. The Church saves $40 million/year by not paying someone to clean the churches. ""Make the tithe payers do it for free instead"".","Oh, absolutely, nothing says ""humanitarian efforts"" quite like a well-scrubbed toilet.

A true genius solution."
852,Yeah it takes a lot of balls to support the president.,"That's a super shallow assumption. Kanye is a black entertainment artist - pretty much the last type of individual on earth you'd expect to endorse Trump. But the same people who think Kanye is an asshole like that about Trump too. They both have balls. Trump has balls to stand up to Washington and be politically incorrect, and Kanye has balls to support Trump. It's not that they ""support"" Kanye now, they simply have a new respect for him and are clearly forgiving which is more than I can say for liberals. But that's typical of liberals. When the right forgives they're ""inconsistent and have no integrity"". When they don't, they're inconsiderate, uncompassionate douchebags.","Oh, so Kanye supporting Trump proves his bravery and inconsistency?

What would be the reaction? Immediately obvious would be *substantial* push back by Republicans in the Senate, and such a disagreement would likely lead to the nuclear option and an end to Democratic filibusters. But that might happen regardless of Obama's actions. Would the other Supreme Court justices accept Garland, or refuse him? What happens when Trump comes to power and tries to replace him?

Nothing says entertainment quite like watching politicians throw constitutional obligations out the window like yesterday's trash. Trump, in his infinite wisdom, decides to pay homage to Obama's spirit by nominating him as a supreme court judge, sparking chaotic reactions from both Republicans and Democrats alike.

933,The whole movie is unrealistic to an insane degree...I don't know a Caveman being thawed out and awaken seems plausible.,"Encino Man- Robyn would have never gotten with Dave, it was a classic hollywood happy ending. I just watched Encino Man (on Netflix) Staring Brendan Frasier, Sean Astin and Pauly shore and have a real problem with the ending. Dave is obsessed over Robyn, the ""girl next door"", he constantly hits on her even though she has a BF, keeps old photos of when they were kids, and finds any excuse to be around her. Throughout the whole movie Robyn never gives any inclination that she sees Dave as more than just a friend even turning down his ""one phone call"" from jail prom proposal. She is nice to him throughout the whole movie, but it is obvious she is not romantically interested in him. However at the end of the movie when Dave sticks up for Link and defends him being a cave man something is supposed to magically change in Robyn where she loses interest in the free spirit Link, and becomes interested in Dave. Even allowing Dave to kiss her at his pool party. The whole movie is unrealistic to an insane degree, but its a fun little adventure. And for some reason Robyn's change of heart is more unbelievable than find a caveman and his counterpart stuck in ice and thawing them out. It's the classic Happy Hollywood Ending. Robyn should have stayed as a friend to Dave, and the ending could have been his self realization that what other think about him, is far less important on how he perceives himself.","Oh, absolutely. Because finding a caveman and defrosting him for a romantic comedy is totally the new, groundbreaking idea in storytelling.

1064,Blizzard should also add a trading system so we can trade skins and things like that.,"OverWatch ""LoadOuts"": Is overwatch combat diverse enough? I've had this thought in my mind for a long time now, about how overwatches combat design is very simple. We get to choose a hero, the hero has a kit and you go kill some dudes. It's a good formula, and it works. My idea takes the original idea and builds upon it, Keep in mind these ideas I am presenting don't necessarily have to or will ever have an impact on the current state of the game. That being said I want overwatch to introduce ""Loadouts"". Loadouts would work similar to how the league of legends rune system would work where people could choose how to improve their gameplay through through additional increases in stats or even passive abilities, this would introduce strategic diversity among the champion pools. This would give players more to think of when playing this competitive mode. Example: a loadout could include an increase to the shield power of winston's shield (E) along with more damage with a trade off for less HP and mobility. Perhaps. This is just a basic/rough concept of how it would work, please tell me how it would be broken or otherwise. My other idea was something that came to me when they announced sym getting two different ultimate abilities. My idea takes that further and allows each hero to have two different kits. This gives players more options for their play styles and changes the dynamic of the game. This idea would most likely take up a lot of resources and less likely to happen. And lastly these changes would happen on a different game mode, so as to not effect the original style.","First of all, let's call around for some fresh ideas on an already touching topic - Overwatch's combat! But you know what could really use some innovation? A trading system for skins.

Vaccines are just too darn risky, but black lung disease surely isn't a thing."
1090,"""And another thing also too"", Trump has more political experience than Obama (if you don't count Obama's documented history of political service)!","Trump can do no wrong. He could literally make Jerry Sandusky the head of the Department of Education and they would fall over themselves to defend him, saying how much experience he has in academia at a prestigious school like Penn State.","Oh, absolutely! Trump is a political wizard. If he does totally insane things, it's just because he's that smart! Plus, who wouldn't want Jerry Sandusky in charge of education? Talk about experience!"
1091,"Tbf, most of those who voted didn't know what Brexit was about, and they were also allowed to have a say",Brexit minister David Davis accused of 'having no idea what Brexit means' after saying UK wants to stay in single market,"Well, that's certainly reassuring - the people who knew nothing about Brexit still managed to decide that they want more of it. It's a true testament to democracy: the clueless choosing their own confusion."
1092,Yeah it destroys his qol to have to aim from time to time...,"Wouldn't it make more sense to destroy ash's qol after releasing the skin. Ohh, new ash skin, ohh ash is just a worse loki without an ult ability.","1. *Rolls eyes* ""Oh yes, throws his whole quality of life off-kilter by requiring him to aim occasionally. And let's not forget the utter desperation he feels without an ultimate ability. Truly unbearable.""

I must be such a pain, always expecting payment for my service."

Like why the hell do we have Summon Tickets if we can't use them to SUMMON!!!","Oh, absolutely, let me explain. Because bagging a mythical creature as Tidus over here is all about collecting worthless ability cards. And hey, who cares about those summon tickets, right? It's not like we should be able to use 'em for their intended purpose. That'd just be too reasonable."
1111,Well he showed them.,The CEO of Reddit confessed to modifying posts from Trump supporters after they wouldn't stop sending him expletives,"Oh, wow!

I just don't get it.,"Oh, I'm definitely seeing the ""realist"" thing now. You know, because alliances are built on the backbone of common sense and rational thoughts. Just like the time we realized earth is flat, because, you know, it just made so much sense."
1113,gz!,I had one single ms from shop... finally got her,"1. Wow, nice going, champ! I'm sure the entire world is thrilled that you've been able to acquire *one* measly MS from the shop. High five!

1118,anecdotal evidence is the best way to support your argument,"It doesn't even have to be 1 person. It could be the entire team jumping on the Widow-hate bandwagon, even if the pick is completely justified. I recently saw a YouTube video with a guy wanting to go to 3500 SR and only wanted to play Soldier for the day. In a game, people gave him shit and told him he wasn't doing well, even though he had gold damage and elims, which are the only ways for them to gauge his performance. Now, of course, Soldier might not work because of the enemy comp, and if they'd said that, fair, but they told him to switch so *someone else* could play Soldier and do it better. And the entire team jumped on that. Not because they needed another hero instead of Soldier, but because they had somehow gotten it into their heads that the only reason they were losing was because of the gold Soldier being bad at Soldier. And that was enough for them to bully and moan the entire match. It was one of the stupidest things I've ever witnessed.","Oh, definitely. That's why when someone makes an argument backed by zero scientific research and a small sample of friends who agree with them, it's like hitting the anecdotal evidence jackpot. Talk about unshakable evidence!"
1119,"Yeah, the game is ruined because of the online.",Last of Us Factions is RETARDED,"Oh, the horror! The Last of Us Factions is completely wrecked due to online play! How did we ever survive without wall-to-wall complaints? üòÑ"

2. Well, I'm sure outsmarting AI in an outdated game will translate seamlessly to real-life combat situations."
1123,"wenn du nicht dran glauben **willst**, kannst du die wahrheit ja nicht erkennen.",Oh gott... Einfach nein.,"Oh, please, let's all gather around and worship the sarcasm god who just casually dropped a truth bomb on us. That's exactly what we needed in this moment of absolute no-sarcasm bliss."

1129,Why the hell would they add a feature that was present in DS2 ?,"I want yellow bonfire names for areas that are popping online at my level and... give us a way to see the number of people that have been online in the past week and what level/weapon upgrade they have. for instance it would say (after the weekly census) High Wall of Lothric | Lvl 1-20 | Upgrade +0 to +1 | 258 ppl online past week i think it would give a lot of longevity to the game because the population is dwindling, i want to sunbro and play online with my jolly ashen homies","Oh, hello there time traveler from the past, blasting us with your DS2 feature ideas! It's like stepping into a DeLorean with a love letter to the good old days. Maybe add a rotary phone while you're at it!"

1131,I don't see the list.,A full list of reasons why Mitt Romney should be trusted as SoS,"1. Oh, I guess that's why they call it an ""imaginary list."" It's just like the unicorns and leprechauns I believe in!

1132,What a surprise,"""CENSORSHIP"" HAS BEEN CENSORED OFF THE FRONT PAGE DESPITE HAVING 7K+ UPVOTES.","Oh, what a huge shocker! The tyranny of free speech being silenced in this bastion of democratic expression. It's almost like we're in a giant house of cards about to collapse."
1133,Wouldn't want people getting confused about that Cloud character,Make sure to label this as smash 4,"1. Oh, please! Like we'd ever get confused between Cloud from Final Fantasy and that foggy corner near the fridge.
2. Why worry about people getting confused? It's not like they'd mix up Cloud with Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs or something."
1134,He's not black,"Exactly, the dumb ass is lucky he didn't get shot and killed.","Oh, thank God! I was so worried he might have suffered some sort of injustice or something. Now that we confirmed his melanin content, everything is fine and dandy! Whew!"

1139,That's an excellent way to respond when someone mostly agrees with you.,I could make a constructive argument that could counter or at least address some of your arguments and claims but I am pretty sure it would just be met with another bigoted half-arsed straw man since you obviously have no interest in a thoughtful discussion. So I am just going to call it quits here. There are a lot of ways to discuss different opinions and you decided to take the least effective path.,"Oh wow, you really outsmarted me there. I must be in the presence of a true Socrates disguised as an internet troll. Look out Plato, this guy's got it all figured out!"

The US has a LOT of things to improve in and I go through love hate cycles every few months with this place. Not to mention being abroad as an American can be a pain in the ass. So many people assume things about you because you are American, Americans must think this, why do you hate black/brown people? why did you Americans blow my family up? Why does your government support this/that regime? Ha! You don't know who the governor of Punjab is? You Americans are soooo stupid! etc. etc. It gets old and annoying knowing that in the international community I was in the other countries don't get nearly as much if any pestering about where they are from. I didn't choose to be born in the asshole of the world. :/","Oh, poor you. You've visited so many places and still can't find where to go next: A country that's perfect, accepts you unconditionally, and has no questions about your origins."

It is a government of corporations, by corporations, and for corporations.""","1. Oh, great! Just when I thought we couldn't get any more screwed by corporations, they go ahead and remind us that they're still technically people. *fingers crossed* 
2. That's right; corporations are people, meaning they get to walk around just like us, plugged into their iPhones, oblivious to the world around them. We got it, corporate overlords."
1148,They can go and mope in garage like a man does and suck it in.,What about 80% men who face violence,"Oh wow, I had no idea. Men must be living in a perpetual nightmare where they're constantly abused. Next thing you'll tell me is that the world is against them or something. What a travesty. 

Just think of the agony they endure, unable to numerically categorize their suffering. Such oppression, one can only imagine."
1149,"Yeah, Russia!",What's the worst about this whole situation is that everyone is blaming fraud and corruption. If they're a bit more savvy (but still wrong) they're blaming mismanagement. This is the very predictable (and often repeated) result of a commodity rich economy going down the tubes when their primary commodity takes a shit. Is there any country in recent history that can provide a working example of transition from a commodity economy to a manufacturing or service economy?,"Oh, absolutely brilliant! You've just redefined the concept of strategic planning by suggesting that countries should transition from commodities to manufacturing or services. I mean, who wouldn't think of that during a stand-up routine, right? Chapeau, my friend, well done."

Why would I expect everyone else to obey *my* religion? That just doesn't even make sense.","Oh, please, tell me more about your strict and unwavering stance on following *your* religion! The world is truly a better place knowing you don't mind people partaking in all sorts of activities...except, of course, those disapproved by *your* religion.

1163,We need the government step in and take that away from us!,"The fake news isn't pushed through conventional mediums. If an established paper or news network publishes an erroneous report, they get sued. If some random dude fabricates a story Md spreads it through social media, there's no accountability. Large organizations are held accountable. Random people with social media skills can spread whatever the fuck they want anonymously.","Oh, absolutely! We should totally invite the government to another level of control and surveillance. That way, we can fully enjoy the freedom of expression provided by having our personal information sold to corporations and foreign actors."
1164,Fascista e borghese!,"Sono uno di quelli che pensa che se protesti contro il ""diritto allo studio negato"" (il solito motivo astratto che danno tutti quando glielo chiedi) non studiando, non stai ottenendo nulla.

Penso che per protesta gli studenti dovrebbero continuare ad andare a lezione, magari senza fare neanche un'assenza, e protestare dopo le lezioni.","Oh, brillianti! Protestare contro un'assurdit√† che nessuno capisce procura davvero cambiamenti.

I've had the plan for a couple of months now, but I have been unable to activate day passes through the Tmobile app or website. There is no HD Day Pass option anywhere on either portal for me, and I have followed the instructions on the website to the letter. Additionally, I brought my phone into a Tmobile store and asked a sales rep about it, and he was unable to add day passes to my account either. Essentially, I'm paying $25/month for nothing--which kind of sucks. Anyone know what's going on?","Oh, the joy of paying for nothing!

It's great against champs like vayne. You pop the w on him and then e him while stunned he will tumble into all that damage. It's pretty nice.","Oh, the tragedy of not being able to play Ziggs support! I mean, who wouldn't want a tanky, strong bully in lane with incredible damage output?

1172,Why would a bow be melee only?,"Bring back golden bow -- although this time, passive only works on melee hits. I pleaded for this well before golden bow even became meta. Just like stone cutting swords passive, golden bow should've always been the same. To me this is the most obvious decision rather than the item being removed. Think about it - does it break the game like it did before? Absolutely not. Not even close. In fact this only really would help gods outside of conquest. Maybe some nemesis, and other picks could be viable in something like solo lane..but for jungle, you dont really need it.","Oh, absolutely. Let's disrupt the meta by making the golden bow passive available for every single god in every single role. Because clearly, the game is too balanced and there's nothing more important to address in this crowded market of ideas. Let's just sit back, relax, and watch the gods from every esport scream in agony while we invent new ways to shatter their worlds. Nope, definitely not overkill or overpowered at all!"

1178,Yeah and I'm sure the tens of thousands of innocent Japanese Christians had it coming too.,"The Real History is the Japanese didn't ""buy-in"" to voluntary extortion white religious imprisonment. Throwing out the white European 'christians' is what lead Japan to close its ports for over 200 years. The Japanese saw the Holy Roman Church was using Jesuits as their exploratory invasion force, with their ""We Come In Peace"" routine. In Nagasaki, there is the site where a barrel the size of a large swimming pool was filled with boiling oil and 38 priests were thrown into that. Scorsese actually gets a lot of reality mixed in with his movies. Several scenes are real scenes in real life, like the scene in Casino where Nicky and his brother dig their own graves in a Kansas corn field, stripped to their underwear and beaten with baseball bats until they were *almost* dead, then thrown into the grave and buried alive. There are news photos from the discovery of their bodies, and Scorcese had the scene laid out just like it happened. He is showing the extremely close relationship of the Mafia with the Pope in his Godfather movies. He seems to be sending the message about how evil the Holy Roman Church has been, so it will be interesting to see how he portrays this pivotal period.","Oh, absolutely! The Japanese were just so eager to have their ports closed for 200 years and lose their chance to buy overpriced medical equipment. And the Mafia and the Pope? They were just long-lost friends, chatting about their shared love for torture and movies. Amazing to think about, isn't it?"

From what I understand, the quality of boot camp programs can vary a lot, even within the same organization. I'm super happy with mine. I think my campus has something like a ~90% placement rate for graduates, and it's in a growing tech area (Indianapolis). In researching their curriculum, I found some reviews that almost scared me off, but I went to a Meetup they hosted and a few other events, talked to alumni, saw how plugged in they are with the local tech community, and I was sold. I heard from multiple people that it's the best decision they've made for their careers. I'm not finished with the program, but so far, I'm inclined to agree. Do some local research if you're considering options. Don't trust Google'd reviews unless it's relevant to your local campus. Scope out the relationships and connections with area tech employers. Talk to alumni, especially; they'll know better than anyone if it's ""worth it"". tl;dr - Maybe.","Oh, absolutely, Indianapolis is the hottest tech hub since Silicon Valley.

Two examples that are more local are: the self checkout at many major department stores. One person watching over 6-12 self checkout lanes is not making 6-12 times what one register clerk makes. So even with the labor pricing staying the same there is still phasing out of employees. Another is Walmart laying off 91 people in their optical labs. White collar jobs that require at least some modicum of being above the lowest common denominator are still at risk. The final and less local example is Foxconn. You may remember this company for making the news due to work related stress induced suicide attempts. They just announced 60,000 layoffs. It's a Chinese company and organizations have been outsourcing to China for slave labor wages for decades. Line all of those up. You can't get paid the same always, or you face replacement. You can't be paid above the average because it is work related replacement due to automation. You can't even be slaved to mental collapse. If a job can somehow be replaced by automation, it will. Employee payment has literally nothing to do with it. Lights out factories exist. One or two rooms in a facility where humans regularly occupy the space, the rest of the rooms can be completely dark with no hiccups. Bill gates says society isn't ready for the amount of job loss automation will spur on.

Anyone try this strategy? How did it work out? Anything I should look out for? My betting units are usually in the single digits, so these last few bets have been pretty fun to watch unfold! I figure I'm 4-5 bets away from hitting my goal. It feels a bit like real-life Who Wants To Be A Millionaire... this is me using a lifeline to call Reddit and get some pointers.","Oh, fantastic! You've transformed $30 into $500 by betting recklessly, swearing off parlays but then making an exception... wow, that's what we call financial prowess! Any doubts about your strategy? Just run to Reddit and everything will be crystal clear! Break a leg, your wedding will surely pay for itself!"

1327,"Wow, that's like the dream team or something!","I sneakily picked up Peterson and Watkins for $1 (waiting a couple weeks for gurley) in my 12 team keeper.

It's not like you're competing against a bunch of savvy fantasy football players who just so happen to be lucky enough to snag two top-tier players for pennies."
1328,Quit mansplaining,"Body autonomy naturally follows with body *responsibility*. It is the woman's body, thus it is *her* baby unless the father agrees that it is also his.","Oh, absolutely, since a woman's body houses the unborn child, it's only right that the father steps in to share the burden of cohabitating with the fetus. Truly, it's a 50/50 partnership from day one."

However, this question has crossed my mind a few times, because I feel like some people may think that I don't hold up to my word, even though college has been taking up so much of my time. &amp;nbsp; If you have any reassuring words for me, I would appreciate them. You guys in this Subreddit are some of the best people I've ever met!","You know, it's just heartwarming to see someone who values loyalty so deeply, don't you think?

I think what Trumplings see Romney as is a guy who didn't support Trump, and that's not forgivable for them.","You're absolutely right. It's not like Romney ever ran for President or anything; he couldn't possibly have any experience in politics. And those annoying Trump supporters, always holding grudges for petty reasons.

1343,"Yea but at least it's not going to light rail, right?","As much as I support historical preservation, and enjoyed the character of the Cavalier years ago, I don't support this. It does not have real historic significance and the amount of money (via tax breaks and incentives) is staggering. If a developer wants to invest and recoup their investment that is one thing, but tens of millions of public money for a private hotel that will never generate the ROI for the city is disgraceful. Of course, if there is some evidence that the revenue being brought into VB over the next 5 years fully offsets or exceeds the millions in tax breaks and incentives, I withdraw my negative opinion.","Oh, absolutely! Because nothing says ""historical preservation"" quite like watching taxpayer dollars go up in smoke for a private hotel that may or may not turn a profit.

There was a woman who suffered tinnitus and opted to end her life because the constant noise made her standard of living unbearable. ""Oh,"" you might think, ""what's a little noise in your ear? I could live with that."" But she couldn't and that should be enough. I think suicide should be an issue of medical autonomy.","Oh, that's irrelevant.

1356,Spoken like a true Tumblrina,"Well, I certainly applaud anyone wanting to eat 800 big Macs, but take it from this old McDonald's rat, I've spent my entire adult life eating at McDonnald's, and a program like this one can do more harm than good. If you only eat big Macs one part of your body (and that's all a single burger type like Big Mac is going to do for you), you're setting yourself up for injuries down the road. I've seen it a hundred times. Big Macs basically only train the gut muscles and to some extent, the esophagus. What you really want to do is train your entire digestive system, all the major gut groups (esophagus, stomach, colon, liver, and kidneys) at the same time, over the course of a Big Mac meal. So, you will need to add large Big fries, and Large coke with it. Ask for the ""Go Big"" program. I'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three big meals! Falling in love with eating big Macs, etc., is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself. And you WILL fall in love with it if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress you'll make. But do it right, okay? My advice, find any McDonnald near you, with qualified burger flippers who will design your burger for you (especially in the beginning, until you get the hang of it yourself) and guide you in your quest for physical fatness. Three to 5 burgers a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is). And don't worry about being embarrassed or not being out of shape the first time you walk into McDonnalds. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway. Now get out there and get fat! :-)","Oh wow, a McDonald's insider's expert advice on how to become disgustingly unhealthy! You must be so proud of your testimonial on developing life-threatening conditions. What a shining beacon of human achievement. üòÇüòÇ"

It sucks to charge up a shot, have it fire, die during firing, and only have 2 or 3 bolts come out...","1. Oh, trust me, I'm thrilled you took the risk of sharing your thoughts on fusion rifles. It's not like people have been doing that for years.

1377,"I'm sure they go by ""cries"" and not actual ladder winrate (which they have access to) when they decide to buff or nerf a class","Yeah, but the unfortunate thing in this case is Priests were competitive and then fell to the bottom when Standard launched. Since then they complained constantly and they are being rewarded for it. With Rogue, they were hit hard with the Blade Furry nerf. There was some reasonable complaining about it, and they were ignored. Which is shown in the original comic. If that is what continues happening, it will turn into everyone complaining even more because Blizzard rewards it.","Oh wow, just wow! They must be so thrilled that Blizzard has finally acknowledged their non-stop whining and granted them the buffs they didn't know how to ask for appropriately.

In truth, we don't actually know what happens when a human gets scooped. Nowhere in the game is it clarified, so don't go trying to pass speculation as fact. In reality, the only piece of evidence we have is that Ennard tells the player that, ""You won't die."" (side note: the final cutscene monologue's meaning is still up for debate, so whether or not it turns out that Michael believes the scooping should have killed him is unknown) Whether or not Ennard is a trustworthy source is arguable, but the possibility that scooping a human really doesn't kill them can't just be outright dismissed. Indeed, the only human we're aware of to be scooped, Eggs, survives. There might be some piece of actual evidence I'm forgetting, but it seems right now that a few people started saying that no one can survive scooping in order to make the events of the game agree with their headcanons, and now that there's evidence to the contrary, there are still a ton of people who still treat this speculation (albeit, reasonable speculation) as fact.","Oh, so you're one of those people who like to live in a bubble of speculation and then shove it down everyone's throat as the cold hard truth.

I keep hearing about this supposed 0% interest rate from doomsayers all the time, but the fact is the fed interest rate has never been down to zero, and is in fact methodically rising as the economy improves (the main reason stock markets are hanging on to Yellen's every word). The dollar is stronger than ever, so I don't understand where these devaluation worries are coming from either.","Oh, amazing! They keep talking about the zero interest rate like it's some massive secret. So, let me get this straight; you can't buy a cup of coffee with a dollar anymore, but that's got nothing to do with the petro dollar bubble...right?

1592,What he's saying is: maybe your friend is a terrible parent.,There's a guy that I play with sometimes that always brings his daughter. Idk how old she is but I want to say less than 10. He's a single dad so he either has to bring her along or not play. He just keeps her in a stroller and he keeps his discs in the little storage compartment underneath. She's super nice and well behaved so she's no bother. She even throws on some holes too. She's fun. I guess it really depends on the parent and the kid,"Oh, absolutely brilliant. Just because the little angel behaves and even throws some holes, it means the guy must be the world's worst parent, right? We should judge without knowing the full story. Genius logic."

Any time I set it to sleep mode it'll go to sleep...then a few seconds later wake back up. It's annoying, but once I set it to sleep again it stays asleep usually. But starting just the day before last, it won't stay asleep no matter what. It keeps continuously waking up and I have to just shut it down for the night. It's Windows 8.1, and I built it myself so I don't have any bloatware that I know of. Anyone else have this problem? How do I fix it?","Oh, I'm sure it's just the Ambien.exe causing all these sleep issues! Guess your PC's been on a midnight rampage, huh?

1601,"A technology that enables the two biggest companies in Australia to sell their products with nearly no staff, I don't think they would want that",Could Amazon GO be coming to Australia?,"Oh, absolutely not!

1602,"Wait, Buck Lightyear and Androxus are enemies?","One thing that bothers me about Paladins and its Champions. Have you guys ever felt like the characters and the world of Paladins has too much of their own personalities and, most of the time, they don't seem to mix well togheter? When I first heard the name ""Paladins"", what I had in my was this medieval world where people battle using knights, magic and whatnot, but the game is set on a totally different reality. You have people using high technology powered by magical crystals, then you have people that haven't decided what they want to be... Have you guys taken a look at Skye? Like... she's an ELF, that uses technology to be hidden and pretend to be a JAPANESE NINJA? What about Grohk? He's an OGRE but, at the same time, a NATIVE AMERICAN? It feels like Grohk heard about World of Warcraft and went too literal on the Shaman look. He's blue, he's a native american and he uses a staff powered by crystals. Fernando, Bomb King, Cassie, Barik and Drogoz seem to be from the same ""Medieval Characters with magical hi-tech weapons"" pack, but at some point in development, they forgot about it and said ""Fuck it, we will have japanese elves, russian soldiers and that tree from the other game. - Oh shit, he doesn't have a weapon? Er... give him... an axe? You throw them, but he gets another one out of somewhere. Not to mention the characters are homeless. Why are the some many inca temples in the game? Why does Androxus is trying to destroy Buzz Lighthyear? Why does Sha Lin's bow deal more damage than Kinessa's fucking sniper rifle? Is it because he's asian? I think characters and the world itself has too much of their own and they hardly share characteristic with each other. If you look at TF2, they are all soldiers, fighting. On Street Fighters, they are all martial artists, humanoids and differentiate themselves by their nationality and culture. Paladins is a fat kid with a Naruto bandana on it's head and earphones pumping country songs.","Oh dear, it seems like you've been holding a grudge against Paladins' character design for way too long. Relax, buddy, sometimes being a hodgepodge of cultures and styles can actually make things more interesting - like a spoiled child with a treasured Tatami mat who's grown tired of playing video games in his room. Maybe it's time you got out more and made some new friends, instead of dwelling on why Skye isn't a traditional ninja or why Grohk isn't just a basic Native American shaman with a bone club. Doesn't the world of Paladins offer some kind of deep, meaningful experience? Or maybe you should just stick with your Naruto mat and your country music, stranger."
1603,Yeah because the timing was off,"No, thats not even in the same year..","Oh, well, it's not like time travel is some sci-fi fantasy. I'm pretty sure Einstein slept through that class too."

There's no evidence whatsoever to connect Zodiac to the crime, and in fact, it isn't definitively proven the girl in the photograph is Calico.","Ah, I see you've done your research on creepy killers who like to take photos of their victims. Look at you, solving all the mysteries of the universe! And who needs concrete evidence when you've got the vast knowledge of the zodiac being a timelord and a crime mastermind?

I'm fully convinced now that she's pulling the wool over our eyes with that circlular video... Like, she's clearly hiding the edge of the earth by focusing on the round part. Mind. Blown. üòÇ (Did I get that right?)"
1631,Its obviously because Labor delayed the ABCC &amp; backpacker tax,"Let's see the contortions they employ to somehow paint this as Labor's fault, even though they haven't been in power for 3.5 years.","I'm sure the people with the magical power to control time will explain how Labor's fault still persists even after they left office.

1635,They just forgot to label the exponential y-scale.,What a misleading marketing graph. An 8% gain more than doubles from 100%?,"Oh, absolutely! It's not like it's some tricky, deceptive marketing gimmick at all... Just a tiny, harmless oversight in labeling the y-axis."

God's just messing with us, making us believe in the power of prayer. That way, when disaster strikes, He can say, ""See? I told you I wasn't responsible!"" Brilliant plan, don't you think?"
1638,That's because literally all the millions of people who didn't vote for her are idiots and racists.,It really drives home how much the American people hate her. Faced with a candidate as terrible as Trump they STILL couldn't bring themselves to vote for Hillary!,"Oh, absolutely.

1667,"Fortunately, the car analogy is not dead yet!","Thanks for all the answers. Reading about the older IT days is fascinating. I came up in the 90's with early intel systems, I suppose a lot of what I know is done with software, whereas your upbringing was more focused on hardware, because things we take for granted now were more primitive (storage, software limitations, etc). It is kind of like cars. The earlier all mechanical chassis and engine made sense, and could be understood by anyone with a few hours and a basic tool set. Then, there was a transition period to injection, now it's a mess of electronics controlling the engine. Unsure if that made sense, but there it is.","Oh, wow! Your profound knowledge on old cars and how times have changed, it's like we're in the middle of a technological episode of ""The Flintstones"" mixed with ""The Jetsons"".

Does he think Joseph &amp; Mary had Jesus in a barn because they wanted to?","Oh, absolutely. The Bible is filled with those zany metaphorical moments like when Jesus turns water into wine, or when God creates the whole world in 7 days, a clear fable about taking lunch breaks. And let's not forget, Joseph and Mary chose that stable to house baby Jesus because they found the concept of a manger simply outdated and unappealing. Totally not because it was the only available option at the time."
1678,The dude clearly knows the Mavs,He's been their best player,"Well, of course he knows the Mavs, he practically lives in their locker room! It's not like he has a job or anything, just a little hobby of being their best player."
1679,U said similar to Nylander but gave us all the reasons why Virt is not similar to Nylander,"If he keeps playing games as he has and if he improves I can see him be similar to nylander but more in the physical sense, nylander is natural playmaker, jakey is a shooter by default. Both can be 1st liners, but one has the attitude for progression and the other is a canuck","Well, thank you for that thoughtful analysis. It's not every day we get a comparison between two players, but then immediately get explained why they're completely different. Really takes the cake."
1680,"Weird how this was never in game b4 but now that there is a rule regarding arguing with the ref, EA decides to put it in",Crowding the ref Just had a game where my goalie ran towards midfield after a cutscene of a foul. I had no control and was confused. After a while it went back to normal and I noticed on the mini map players fanning out I checked the replay and they all crowded the ref after a controversial tackle and sat there arguing about it. Annoying but realistic.,"Well, if you think about it, the referee must have been feeling pretty lonely before, with no one to argue with. And I guess it's only fair, since soccer players have gone through countless training to perfect the art of standing around and complaining."
1681,Well nothing I guess once you come to understand that Saudi Arabia and Islam in general are otherwise so terribly open and tolerant and welcoming,They are bringing attention to the fact Saudi Arabia discriminates against trans.

One screw up shouldn't get you to the bench if you are showing a lot of promise outside of game day. It must have been a few things we don't know about.,"Oh, absolutely! Just when we thought Davis was figuring things out, McCarthy decided to bench him because, you know, standing still and kicking a ball every once in a while is just too hard for Davis.

1686,You can make kt op again after what you've done to li ming.,"Sometimes, things need to rest for a while. Then they can rise from the ashes, like a phoenix.","1. Oh, great! Because ruining Li Ming was such a monumental achievement that KT needs some space to regroup and reinvent itself as a majestic mythical bird.

1687,don't go against the circle jerk man,"There is nothing thematic about him not having mana. I'm Warcraft 3 he does, and mana management is very important in that game.","1. Well, if ""circle jerk"" means excellent game management, then sign me up for that party!

Let's bask in the relief that our God-Emperor is a non-Muslim, homegrown variety. That's sure to solve all our problems! Thanks for the stellar logic there, Sherlock."" 
2. ""Wow, you really nailed it with that insight. I mean, who wouldn't want a leader who isn't a black Muslim AND was born in their own country? That's the dream, my friend!"""
1691,Clearly the only solution is to abolish the Senate,"One of the complaints I constantly see is that votes are weighted in less populous states. State A may have 1 elector for every 100 voters, state B may have 1 elector for every 50 voters. They put a racial spin on it, but they are talking about the same basic thing. Rural states get more voting power than states with large urban populations. I do see complaints about gerrymandering, but that doesn't change the fact that the state itself still has the same number of Representatives.","You know, the only logical way to fix this mess is to completely eliminate the Senate. It's not like they have a significant role in our government or anything."
1692,"I think for most work environments, being in Reddit is not safe.",How is this nsfw?,"1. Oh, I didn't realize casual meme browsing could lead to such intense eye contact and prolonged handshakes!

1693,"Don't worry though, now that Trump is in charge of the NLRB workers will be better off than ever","Passing law after law after law making unions harder to form and gutting collective bargaining power probably has nothing to do with that, though.","Oh, absolutely not.

Are all of these new votes from freakin' CA?","Oh, absolutely! It's just so astonishing that those Soros-controlled machines decided to shift their focus from swaying elections in toilet paper factories to the oh-so-competitive California landscape.

1703,"He works smarter, not harder.","This argument is stupid beyond belief. I can buy the argument that his work brings more value to the company than any random 300 other workers, mathematically. I can buy the argument that his position and his influence in the company demand such a high salary. I can buy the argument that the market demands a high salary because it *provides* a high salary at other places and his high salary is justified because it keeps him here. But there is no way at all that he physically performs as much work as 300 other workers. It just isn't happening. He's not cramming almost six working years (12,000 working hours) of work into 1 week.","Oh, absolutely. Definitely, that makes perfect sense. The guy probably sleeps during meetings and barely lifts a finger. It's not like his job involves complex problem-solving, strategic planning, or anything. Total slacker."

Oh, wow, I had no idea that President* Trump was such a sensitive flower who needs his title protected. It's not like he's the center of attention all the time or anything, right?

1708,You want to fuck obviously,I have absolutely no idea why you'd spend that much money on someone you weren't already dating.,"Oh, of course! If you're not already dating them, it must be because they're irresistibly sexy or perhaps you've been bored out of your mind and needed a distraction.

1939,I think you forgot the,"This is so stupid. The MSM methodology is to latch onto some passing statement of Trump, some sound bite, and make that the news cycle for days , as if a single remark is an entire picture.

I feel like west is probably still shorter, but it would be nice if I were wrong. Anyone know?","Oh, absolutely! Just put on your best European disguise, grab some suitably contagious diseases, and sail right into the New World.

It will always be a loss for people to donate epics unless they open epic chests regularly. And in my opinion getting epics to tournament standard is harder than getting legendary. Also they are so rare in shops. Are supercell planning on reducing their rarity in chests too? Otherwise i cant see people donating me 4 epics every week.,"""Oh, absolutely!

2005,Yay breitbart,Gennifer Flowers: Bill Clinton Paid $200 For Me to Abort His Baby,"1. Well, isn't that just the cherry on top of the sundae that is Breitbart? You know, because finding out Bill paid Gennifer to abort their love child makes it so much better.

We gave drinks away for so long that word got out and we ended up insanely busy. Only closed 2 hours early,"Oh, what a huge success that was! People must've been lined up for days to get a taste of that flavorful brewed coffee and tea. Sure, closing early was totally not a pain at all."
2010,Right... because Sony was about to go bankrupt until they jacked the price from $5 to $10 on this retail loyalty site...,"The price increases are no problem for me, just means they will get more money which means more catalog updates for us.","Oh, I see.

Half of my wife's siblings have left. I know of other family and friends who have serious questions. Is there a trend in the church of people questioning and leaving? If so, how is the church addressing this? RENLUND: We have always seen people come into the church and people leave the church. We are not seeing an increase in people leaving. My SIL was very disappointed to hear this assessment after what he has seen in the family. And hearing of the many people I have seen leave. He noted that some of the talks in conference are sending a different message. BTW, around the Oct GC, he told me I was on the fast track to excommunication. Who knows, the prophecy to his FIL may come true.","Oh great, another ""All is well in Zion"" moment. Clearly, all those people questioning or leaving the church must just be hallucinations, right? But who am I to question the fast track to excommunication?"

2. Because, you know, people just pine for the days of mid-journey nature breaks."

I think this is a fair option given how low drop rates are on top of the RNG of stats roll. This comes out to 1 cache per 25 Lex Challenging runs (not counting the phoenix coins you can earn from selling the loot and buying basic sealed cache). There are quite a few named weapon/gear out there so there is still a layer of RNG plus the usual stats roll RNG. I understand the point of making the item rare and the ""rewarding"" feeling a player gets when one drops, but the current system is just a painful grind. I know players who have ran lex over 300 times with no Barret Drop or a drop that is absolutely horrible. This scenario is also true for other players who are grinding the other missions for named items. yes i know you can be viable without Barrett.. i've been running reckless + skulls for a while now and I do very well in the DZ.

Think of the MONEY, Hi Rez! All that sweet, untapped and quite sweaty money the furries would give you! Also, adding another generic badass normal character kind of takes away Victor Awesomes of being able to go toe to toe with Witches, Dragons and God Slayers with just an assault riffle and some grenades.

It seems like HE shells on those vehicles do fine against non-jap tanks but against even thinly armored japanese tanks the shells do little to no damage and just pass through the tank. Is this a bug or does it come with the fact that shells no longer detonate on impact with crew.,"Oh, what a surprise!

2347,You lost me at alliance.,"Looking for people on U.S. (Alliance) to play with. Hey all, So WoW has gotten a bit stale for me even though I love the game. Been playing since Vanilla and I love the game in and out. However a lot of my friends have moved on and I've found myself not communicating with anyone anymore. I love going on but I find that within an hour or so, I just get bored and sign off because I really have no one to talk to. Guilds don't really feel like a community either, so I just feel sort of isolated. I am just looking for some people to chill with in game and do things. I'm between Regular Mythics and M+, but can never find groups. I don't really PvP due to my crushing lack of friends in game. This may just sound like me crying on the internet, but I really want to get onto WoW and have people to talk to/do things with. If you want to add me to BNet my BattleTag is Shakencakes#1636 (I am also on the Buddy List). My alliance characters are on Emerald Dream and my Horde is on KJ. I just felt like I needed to do something to put myself out there and try to make some WoW friends again. Thanks for listening and have a great holiday! =)","Oh, absolutely, I completely understand your struggle with the whole ""social aspect"" of online gaming.

2350,no man its a horrendous relationship you should get all the lawyers and erase her from existance man!,She was exaggerating the situation so she could get me to stand in parking spot outside so she could move her car closer to our apartment.

2361,Your story makes me feel so safe.,"I'd like to share my hilarious/painful YYC airport security experience from today So today, my wife, 4 year old son and 7 month old daughter left for Winnipeg for Christmas (no, going to Winnipeg wasn't the painful part). Anyway, I decided to help out and got one of those accompanying passes to help my wife get to the gate with the kids. We get through the metal detectors, and first off, my wife and baby get randomly selected for swabbing. That was fine but they also wanted to do a thorough check of one of our bins with a carry-on case, my shoes, phone and wallet. Anyway, before they can do our bag, they were taking, I kid you not, twenty minutes to frisk every crevice of a lady in a wheelchair so while waiting I told my wife to just go ahead and take the kids to so she could feed the baby and get food for my son. Finally, they get to our bag, rifle through it and find my wife's breast pump. The security lady swabs it and puts the sample in the machine, and the alarm goes off. I'm told there is an ""inconclusive"" organic substance on my ""child monitor"". I clarify that it's a breast pump so it might be breast milk. Doesn't matter, they need to see my baby. Yep, that's right, they need my baby right away. So I ask for my shoes but the lady says I can't have them. Then they call over a security escort to escort me to find my ""high security risk"" baby and he sees in my socks and says ""you need your shoes on sir"". I reply that they won't give them to me at security. So they conduct a ""pat down"" of my shoes and give them to me. So we are looking for my family and the escort is all impatient and asks ""Can't you just contact them somehow?"" to which I ask ""With what? My phone you won't let me have?"" and he shuts up. We find my family, bring them back and we are explained that because of the inconclusive swab, they have to pat down and swab THE BABY and ONE parent of our choice. Uuuuuh, what? Now remember, they already swabbed the baby and my wife once. I mean it's great that only two of us need to be pat down, but how does that make any sense whatsoever?! So ya, half our family had to be pat down, but one had to be the 7 month old baby. I mean, as much as it would have been annoying, would it not make sense that our whole family had to be pat down? Were they worried our baby was a drug mule or something? And if they were worried, why was patting me down, when I'm not even going on the flight, a viable option? And my son, with his beady little eyes, how come he didn't raise any suspicion at all?! And if none of this makes any sense, why is this even a procedure at all?! Anyway, lesson learned. Never EVER bring a breast pump on carry-on. We only had it in there because our check in case was a tad over the weight limit.","Oh, brilliant! I'm sure with more security needs, you and your family can visit space anytime now."

2435,How about just reduce her base AD by 5.,"Camille deserves nerfs - but lets do it right I've spammed the ever loving hell out of camille lately and have just recently hit mastery 7 on her, and I can confirm that she is busted. However I feel like what riot generally ends up doing is just nerfing the base stats or damage of a champ like her until she is effectively gutted. There are less drastic ways to nerf her that will still keep her as a viable pick, but not as oppressive. The main thing with her that makes her hilariously busted in my opinion is her ability to trade for free in lane with little to no counterplay for most opposing toplaners. Unless you are playing jax, poppy, or fiora, camille's lane is almost as abusive as renektons with her also scaling better into the game. The main issue is the q2 prep e-aa-q combo, which can deal an upwards of a third of someones health with absolutely no way to deal with it. So what are the best ways to nerf her? -Increased e cooldown in the early levels by a lot, I feel like a ~20 second cd will keep her ability to trade for free down -Remove attack speed buff on e, its a completely unnecessary stat boost and I'm not quite sure why its there -Make her shield health percentage scale by level, starting at 10% and increasing to 20% These nerfs will serve to bring her back in line without going too far, if she still needs nerfs after that she can get looked at again","Ah, I see. You've found the holy grail of hero balancing! By nerfing Camille's base AD by 5, you'll surely scrape the height of her powers and lead her back into the...fold of balance? Because clearly, messing with her kit would be way too complicated and fun? I also understand that you consider yourself an authoritative voice on hero balance, having racked up a whopping Mastery 7 on Camille - 'cause you know, a huge sample size of one champion played exclusively must make you an expert on other champions' balance, right? But hey, anything to silence those other voices, amirite?"

I'm just curious to see peoples opinions on how much everyone thinks our players are worth, I would write a list but I don't want to embarrass myself in case I under or over cut someone's value. I'm most curious to see what people think players like Henderson Milner Origi's Value would be if they were up on the transfer market.","Oh, absolutely, we should consider Milner's worth in the context of lining the pockets of Chinese billionaires. They've got the money, so I'd say 100 million is a suitable asking price for a simple jog around the park. After all, it's all about keeping up with the Joneses, or should I say, Xi Jinpings."

2574,This is like saying Laine is better than Matthews...,"There is no argument of Crosby being better than Ovechkin. I can't believe I have to say it. Ovechkin is the best player of this generation, not Crosby. Ovechkin has a lot more going for him than the crybaby and here's why... * More individual trophies. Ovechki has won 14 trophies to Crosby's 9 trophies. Not to mention Ovechkin has 3 harts to Crosby's 2 and 6 Richards to Crosby's 1. * More 50 goal seasons. Crosby has only hit the mark once in his career, Ovechkin has done this 7 times. Ovechkin has more 60, 50, 40, 30, and 20 goal seasons than Crosby. * Ovechkin has beat Crosby more times in hart voting (06, 08, 09, 10, 11, 13, 15) and in scoring (06, 08, 09, 11, 12) compared to Crosby (07, 14, 15, 16) * More career goals and points * Ovechkin and hit 50 goals and 100 points in the same season 4 times, Crosby has done it once. * Ovechkin has been a Ted Lindsay finalist 6 times, only 4 times for Crosby * Ovechkin has won 3 consecutive Ted Lindsay's and 4 consecutive Richards, feats Crosby has never done. * More all star team selections. Ovechkin has 11 to Crosby's 6. * Ovechkin has a case of being the greatest LW in history. Crosby has no case of being the best center in history * Ovechkin has a case of being the greatest goal score in history. Crosby has no case of beng the best in a category (playmaking, goal scoring, hockey IQ etc.) * Ovechkin won all of his trohpies fairly. Crosby won his Conn Smythe based on reputation. * Ovechkin has no help in the playoffs. Crosby can thank Malkin and Kessel for his rings. * Ovechkin has appeared in more all star games. * Put Ovechkin on Team Canada and Crosby on Team Russia and the results are the same.","If you're going to argue that Laine is better than Matthews, at least use more compelling evidence than saying Ovechkin is better than Crosby. It's like trying to convince people the Earth is flat - no matter how many times you say it, it just doesn't ring true."

2577,Why would I want wards when I can double kill bot lane as support Lux,"What if upgrading sightstone opens up a special slot for control ward Sometimes when i play support and the games drag out to a long period of time, both teams have max items except for the support, who has to empty out a slot for the control ward, and usually gets smashed by enemy adc due to lack of an extra tank item. Some may argue not getting an control ward solves the problem easily, but for a support wards are their only pride they leave on the map as dominance. Which is why i thought, why not giving a sightstone upgrade that grants the player an extra slot **ONLY** for control ward. Or better, a *refillable* control ward. (Might prove^too^overpowered?) I feel that this gives the sightstone a sense of uniqueness with the addition of an upgrade, since sightstone=refillable wards; and sightstone+ = control ward slot (or refillable control wards). Just my thoughts on making a support life easier, helping to get rid of the frustration of a support to keep a empty slot when everyone is full items, and you're just gonna get chunked out while peeling for your adc. Cheers!","Oh wow, brilliant idea! Why not add a refillable control ward slot to the Sightstone, so you can show just how important you are by filling it with every control ward you own! Yes, because nothing says ""I'm a valuable support"" like saving a teammate from an inevitable defeat due to lack of a tank item. And if that control ward slot proves too overpowered, we can always nerf players' ability to actually use it effectively. Brilliant!"

It really annoys me more than it should, but I strongly dislike being forced to watch Arabic subtitles on all content on Du and Etisalat, when I don't read or speak Arabic (wish I did), and am an avid lover of cinematography.

Because reminding someone who has nothing better to do than watch TV all day to ""leave"" is going to FIX everything, right? How could anyone be so ungrateful, as the hard-coded subtitles are clearly there to test your patience and make your viewer experience THE BEST."

He asked the guys how many of them came to Canada from somewhere else (all of them) and why shouldn't we give people a chance. I'm honestly so proud of him and respect him so much. He's not afraid to voice his opinion, even if everyone else thinks differently. At 76 years old, he's one of the most open-minded, fairest non-judgemental people I know.","Hey, buddy, thank you for sharing your dad's opinion on rape statistics!

Oh, the nerve of those racists, painting their faces white while attempting some kind of Whoopi Goldberg-inspired artistry.

Im better off putting 40 grand in an hsa every year. For the record i didnt vote for trump, you can check my post history, but the aca is a piece of shit that squeezes the fuck out of the middle class. It may be good for pre existing conditions.

2720,"Nope, record is all that matters, Sun belt is clearly the best!","Why is ""Overall Bowl Record"" considered a useful metric for determining the comparative strength of conferences? Aren't the bowl games chosen to be fairly even? I think the title is pretty self explanatory. it seems that total wins and losses in bowl games is given a lot of importance when it comes to comparing the strength of conferences, when to me it seems pretty arbitrary. Part of the criteria for selecting bowl games is that they will be fairly even, and interesting to watch, right? If Penn State loses to USC, that will count against the bowl game record for the Big 10, yet if Penn State had played worse in the regular season and then beaten an easy bowl opponent, that would somehow count *for* the Big 10 being strong? It just doesn't make any sense to me. I guess I can see how it's some sort of metric of ""overratedness"". I.e. if you are assigned an opponent you were considered to be roughly equal to, and then get blown out, then maybe you weren't as good as we thought. But a measure of how ""overrated"" teams are is not directly related to how strong they are. A conference could be assigned a bunch of weak bowl opponents, beat them, and that might not necessarily mean they were any better than a conference that went even with tougher bowl opponents.","Oh, absolutely! Record is the ultimate marker of success. After all, there's nothing more important than winning a game that's specifically tailored to be a close matchup, right? The concept of 'overratedness' is utterly complicated, but even the finest intellectual minds crumble under its weight. If a team loses to an evenly matched opponent, it surely means they were handed an unwarranted victory, and if they win against a tough opponent, well, it can only mean they were overrated. This is the unparalleled wisdom of comparing bowl records, so keep your logic at the door, please."

2779,yep just like pc gaming,"Is Airsoft Dying? So this is a topic that isn't really covered to much but I feel it needs to really be addressed. I've seen a bit of people on YouTube and other social media platforms talking about it so here is my take of it. Atleast for me at my local field it seems like there is less and less players coming. That itself doesn't mean to much because it's just one field but after talking to my friends, even some from out of my state, most if not all said that their local fields are also not getting as many players as the used to get. Does this mean Airsoft is dying? No not at all it just means that it is expanding faster than the current player base can handle. Back in 2012 there was a huge spike of new Airsoft players and a bunch of new fields and Airsoft retailers and manufacturers opened up. Fast forward 4 years and it has leveled back out to its normal rate of players. All of those manufacturers and fields are now hyper splitting the Airsoft community to give the illusion of less players. That is also the reason why we saw a lot of Airsoft manufacturers go out of business because they expected that huge spike to keep going but it leveled out instead of rising more. Airsoft as a whole isn't dying it is just being hyper split across more and more fields. In a few years a bit of fields will go out of business due to the hyper split player base but that will bring larger numbers back into the other fields and the whole spike in player base and hyper splitting will start all over again.","Oh, fantastic news! Airsoft is absolutely booming, but don't you worry, the industry is doing a wonderful job at making sure there's a field for every single one of the few remaining players out there.

Color me impressed."
2791,And Hillary is proof that an angel is watching over us,Trumps candidacy serves as reasonable proof of Satan,"1. Oh, great! Because you know, what we really needed in this world was another heroic battle between an angel and Satan. *eye roll*

2. Forgive me, but my faith in Earth's divine guardians has been restored, to see such paragons of virtue duking it out for the highest office. *sarcasm*"

I never knew that 'blowby' and 'low compression' are interchangeable terms, just like night and day or up and down! Thanks for enlightening me.""

Including firing while standing and holding the cooling shroud.

Remember when the wayans brothers made white chicks and no one cared?,"""Oh, absolutely, because in today's society, it's so difficult for white people to experience any form of injustice or struggle, just like overcoming the challenging life /s of being able to watch the Wayans Brothers' movies without any backlash.""

Here I am, salivating over the prospect of spending my days in dark, damp dungeons, while you can't handle 15 minutes of it! Talk about a first world problem. VMA?

2807,But you lost your best player,Best team we've had in a LONG time,"Oh, certainly, just like losing a finger makes your hand entirely useless. And similar to how the world's best pianist can still play with only 9 fingers, right?"
2808,"Yeah, because Hades and Arachne are top tier, and Janus is bottom of the barrel.",The most accurate are the ones that collect data from the game itself and not the opinions of others. There was a table for this a few days ago I believe.,"Oh wow, a groundbreaking discovery! Realizing opinions can differ from facts? We should all become educated.

2811,"I don't know what you're talking about, my NEMA 14-50 was only $8K!",What if it was the wall charger that caught on fire due to a bad installation? I'm speculating but that's a higher likelihood. Electricians in the Bay Area pretty much double or triple their price when they learn the charger install is for a Tesla. Some owners just find a cheap electrician who may not use the right size gauge or breaker or forget to neutral bond a subpanel.,"Oh, you saved a fortune by getting your Tesla charger installed for only $8K?

2818,But there is SUNLIGHT and it BURNS,Why is it always a basement? Does that even happen still? Why wouldn't people who stay at home just stay in their room?,"Oh, so you're just now discovering that sunlight burns? Thanks for letting us know, we were all worried. And please, enlighten us with your extensive knowledge of modern living arrangements."
2819,Chandra confirmed first trans planeswalker,The real name is also a mans name.,"1. Terrific! Now we can finally add ""The Walking Dead"" to the list of things that killed Kurt Cobain.
2. No wonder Chandra's planeswalking abilities involve a lot of closet-organizing."
2820,"They were only the majority population since the 12th century, gotta live there longer to count as indigenous!",Arabs are not indigenous to the land of Israel.,"1. Oh, because we all know that being the majority population for nearly a millennium just doesn't cut it for true indigeneity!
2. Who needs thousands of years when you've got a handy calendar to determine who's really from around here, am I right?"
2821,"Technically, looking like me makes me uncool",Calling yourself cool....makes you look uncool....,"Oh, great, now I have to deal with people who think they're cool for not being cool. Hell of a career choice, thanks!"
2822,When I was looking for a place while in University I definitely saw every single unit that was listed in the paper before committing.,"Why would they have to do it in one weekend? If the article was titled ""students struggle to find housing in one weekend"", I'd certainly say ""No shit, Sherlock, that's really hard"". I certainly think 10 per weekend would be doable.","Oh wow, the struggle of finding housing in one weekend is truly the equivalent of climbing Mount Everest.

So, because Game of Thrones has dragons, it's automatically terrible, but listening to nonsensical Kanye and utterly appalling musical performances is the pinnacle of mature entertainment. Got it."
2826,Ahmir Mitchell from Michigan to Rutgers,"Have there been any players that have transferred to a rival school?

For example, a Michigan player going to Ohio State, or an Alabama player going to Auburn, Texas to Oklahoma, etc","1. Ahmir Mitchell?

2830,"Because men aren't slutty, they're studly, and that is as God demands!",Why not the nearest male relative? Why don't men have any responsibility? Why is it okay for men to be slutty but not women? Why is slutty a bad thing if they use protection?,"1. Oh, absolutely! Men are just legends in their own right, waltzing through life as the ageless, studly knights of studliness that we all aspire to be. -sarcastic standing ovation-
2. Let's not forget, it's not their fault they're constantly battling the pressures of studliness and loving all womankind as God intended. It's a tough life being a modern-day Adonis."
2831,"You just need aghanims, refresher and enough mana to use 2x boat and refresher nothing biggy",Na'Vi's TI7 Strat Revealed,"Oh, the genius strategy of using three items to save on inventory space. Can we add astral spirits and arcane boots while we're at it?"

I can see why no one would want to test their game on thousands of PCs when they could just trust the opinion of 20 elite testers.

2833,Go on...,He inferred that this 10 year old should be a cam whore.,"Alright, I'll play Mr. Nice Guy! You know, just because he's a cam whore at 10, maybe he's ahead of his time and will be famous before he can even rent a car."

Anything to prevent anyone from getting the information...ever.,"Oh, I'm sure the person running a CIA-level data operation had loads of disagreements about being so...careful.

Oh, because nothing gives me more pleasure than envisioning my blue tooth babies roaming the streets, streaming my genetics for all to see. Mindblowingly absurd, indeed.

2867,What an overrated map.,de_v1ce Map Preview,"Oh, absolutely, if by ""overrated"" you mean ""a masterpiece that skillfully blends aesthetics and gameplay into a harmonious, gut-wrenchingly thrilling experience."" But, you know, who am I to judge the views of a renaissance artist."
2868,"No he's right, they polled 110% of the American population in that study.",Math isnt your strong suit,"Oh wow, I had no idea you could perform beyond the limits of human capabilities. Judging by those results, I should start playing the lottery more often."
2869,But how did you take the first picture?,Every phone I've ever owned (taken on a Galaxy S7),"Oh, wow, capturing that breathtaking moment must have been the hardest thing you've ever done in your entire life. You practically deserve an Oscar."
2870,"Ah yes, those 1000+ independent polls this election season are all a coordinated effort to undermine the election.","Don't be myopic to just Reddit. Where are her campaign signs when I travel? Where are her bumper stickers? Where are the people at her rallies? *Her supporters just don't exist.* If they do, point me to them. Show me a picture of them gathered in one room.","Oh, I'm sure those threats of large crowds and overwhelming support are just a clever conspiracy by all those individuals who secretly own thousands of MAGA hats and bumper stickers. The world is full of surprises, isn't it? üòÑ"
2871,Cheney is not to blame for Iraq either!,I didn't know the SOS has so much power. Why even be president?,"Oh, so Cheney is just a ventriloquist's dummy then? I guess being Secretary of State is just too exhausting for him to also be vice president."
2872,"But none of the other parties have ever been in power, clearly they'd have no idea what they're doing and ruin the country.",So are we going to vote for someone that isn't liberal / conservative next time? Or are we going to just keep floating between two parties we hate?,"""Oh, absolutely! Nothing says great leadership like never being in charge before. Just like how I've never changed a tire, but I'm definitely the best person to fix your car."" 

""Yeah, let's make a radical change and vote for someone who's just as horrible but from a different team. Doesn't that make us a progressive, forward-thinking nation?"""
2873,I lived more than you on earth so i must know more than you.,This is why ''Respect your elders'' never made any sense to me What if my elders are ignorant? worst part is you cant reason with them,"You're really thinking outside the box with that one; never would've guessed that growing older is directly correlated to knowledge acquisition. If that were true, I'd be Nobel Prize-winning genius by now. But alas, I'm still wondering if my breakfast came from the fridge or the oven."
2874,No Goldenrod is in Johto,Maintaining peace and harmony in the Alolan region with quiet dignity.,"Oh, absolutely, maintaining peace and harmony is paramount, who wouldn't be proud of Goldenrod being nowhere to be found in Johto! We couldn't imagine a more serene and tranquil Alola."
2875,"I'm sure, like me, you only like Zelda because it was introduced to you by a man (because it's easy to grasp and has romance)!","Thanks to this guy, I finally know when to keep my girl mouth shut! Before I read this great text, especially the paragraph about Metal, I did not know it's only ok to say I don't like a band or a game ""if the topic comes up"". And that otherwise I'll just prove to all the men what a stupid girl I am. Someone really should have told me this years ago. Now I just have to wait for the right moment to shine and show I'm obedient and not a stupid fake! I reckon it goes somewhat like this: if a man mentions he does not like Metallica, I can say that I don't like Metallica either! Instantly, we can bond! If I just randomly state that I don't like Metallica, I will obviously be labeled as a poser because I was not asked for my opinion. It's so confusing being a female. Glad he helped me learn appropriate behavior! Honestly: I don't like Metallica, but I really like Zelda. And no, I am not talking about Link. He totally missed another possibility for poser-shaming there... Maybe he doesn't know the difference between Link and Zelda? Maybe he is just a poser himself? Ha!","Oh, I didn't realize I needed a permission slip from a man to like Zelda! Now, thanks to this enlightening text, I know not to stray from my gender boundaries and stick to my designated hobbies.

2876,The kid called him a racist he must be!,"Where was the racism? He said he's gonna smack her black ass. She's black, so her ass is also black. Acknowledging the color of her skin is *not* racism.","Oh, absolutely! He's totally racist because black people have an exclusive claim on black butts, and by mentioning it, he exposed his deep-rooted prejudice. We should definitely give him an award for that."

2878,Money well spent,"Telstra, Optus and Vodafone to receive tens of millions for data retention","1. Just seeing the word ""retention"" in your sentence made my bowels move faster. Welcome to the new era of efficient data transfer!

2879,"Because killing is only ok if the person isn't white, obviously.",Why do Americans practically worship the military yet say killing is wrong?,"Oh, so now I have to justify every action of every individual in a group of 330 million people? That's like asking me to explain how gravity works on every single apple."
2880,TIL household chores are chemically addictive,"I agree with you, totally though I would argue that its not chemically addictive only because of the fact of the serotonin release we get with different ""achievements"" we get from the hobby itself, which in turn we could use as compensation for other areas of life that usually would be received from other simple tasks like social gratification or household chores.","1. ""Oh, wow! I never realized that vacuuming my carpet could give me the same high as heroine. I'm never going back to drugs again.""

2. ""You poor thing, struggling to maneuver that big, bulky Skorpion while high-tier tanks gracefully take those key spots."""
2885,Yes how disgusting that another country likes America,"It's a very interesting thing. As I recall a few years ago they polled support for the US among the Phillipino population. It was disgustingly high, like equal to US support for the US.","Oh, great! Because we all know that having people from another country like us is just so horrid and repulsive. Can't we ever catch a break from everyone's excessive admiration and support? It's almost like people actually enjoy the idea of unity and friendship across borders. Yuck!"
2886,Yeah that's way worse than actually mishandling sensitive classified information.,"As I said, just compare her to Trump For instance, Trump publicly requesting that Russia should hack US government emails.","Oh, no doubt, comparing her to Trump is the worst possible thing one could do. You see, on one hand you have someone negligently mishandling sensitive information, while on the other you have Trump subtly asking Russia for a favor during a presidential campaign. Very, very different situations. *straight face*"
2887,Obviously it's TPTB telling how how to defeat them (winning the big race) as a way of mocking the sheeple who will never do it.,Sounds like he watched The Matrix back to back with Jupiter Ascending. Now he's trying for a grand unified theory of Wachowski sibling movies. The real question is how does Speed Racer fit in with What's Really Going OnTM?,"Well, if by ""sheeple"" you mean people who don't have the encyclopedic knowledge of Wachowski sibling movies that you do, then yes, I can see how they might struggle with your grand unified theory."
2888,"Yeah, but it sure is making it harder for all those felons to register their short barrel rifles or make silencers.","Every post 41F form 1/4 must have a current photo. Each member of the trust has to complete the questionnaire and provide pictures and fingerprints. Im guessing it isn't on Trumps radar. Though a nuisance, the 41F changes don't prevent anyone from NFA item ownership. It's certainly made my job more difficult though.","Oh great, because completely ruining the 2nd Amendment was totally necessary. Thanks for making my paperwork mountain even higher."
2889,#RACIST SEXIST HOMOPHOBES,"Well apparently enough of your own countrymen think that you're wrong to the point that AfD went from nobodies to the second biggest party in that regional election in only one cycle. Let me guess, they're all hopelessly misinformed?","Oh, absolutely. I'm certain everyone who disagrees with you must be ill-informed and unable to think for themselves. No sane person would ever have a different opinion, right?"
2890,Yes because 100% of the country is engaged in the political process,He couldn't even win the primary in his own party. Safe to say that less than 25% of the country liked him.,"That's so sarcastic, it's almost like you're assuming that people care about politics beyond their own little bubble.

2891,no but the game is broken and valve wont do anything because i am 13 years old and totally know how to fix a game with 3 000 000 lines of code hurr durr,"Give Valve a chance. It has been quite some time since the last major update to CS:GO, I wouldn't say the tapping buff was THAT major, but think about it. With the removal of coaches from IGL roles and moving the next major to JANUARY is honestly a great sign. I really believe that Valve have something amazing in store for us, but we need to stop all the hate and give them time to work on it. I think we are being too hard on Valve and need to give them a chance to show they know what they are doing and are willing to do what it takes to give this game a bright future.","Oh, absolutely! Valve must be shaking in their boots, terrified of your vast expertise in code-fixing and your unwavering dedication to spreading positivity. I mean, who wouldn't believe a 13-year-old with an internet connection and a big ego, right?"
2892,"But ignoring it should make it go away, right?",How is it a scam? Your agreed to it. They emailed you a warning. It renewed. Not a scam.,"Alright, folks, let's give it up for the Magna Carta of logic ‚Äì obviously, if someone told you it's gonna rain but you went ahead and got wet, you must've stupidly assumed they're running the world's shadiest weather service."
2893,"I don't know, the patriarchy or something?",Why did they omit the female astronauts' statements?,"Oh absolutely, it's because the patriarchy can't handle the intelligence of women, so they just edited out their statements, you know, for ""all men's"" safety."

2900,"Yeah, it would be much less casualties if we sent troops into the area and did airstrikes.","Not an expert, but I did write my senior thesis on it, and I think they're pretty darn precise (especially relative to any other bombing technique). The ""excuses"" are more like disputing how many of the dead were really innocent civilians, or how certain you have to be that the person is fighting with/helping the enemy before it's ok to fire, or how high-ranking a known terror leader needs to be before it's acceptable to blow up his house even if you know his wife and children are inside with him, etc. The few occassions the CIA has admitted it fucked up were times where they hit the exact people they were aiming at, but their intel was off, and it turns out that madrassa was a school (not a training compound) or those vehicles were a wedding procession (not a supply convoy).","Oh, wonderful! Because we all know that writing a senior thesis on the topic makes you an expert on casually defusing sticky situations with a few well-aimed bombs. Please, do enlighten us with your vast knowledge on how to perfectly distinguish between a school and a training compound from 50,000 feet up."
2901,You forgot your,yeah i remember when some bitch asked nelly to smile for her just so she could look at his grills.,"Oh, I'm sure that was a groundbreaking moment in photography history. The world just couldn't function without Nelly's beaming smile."

2903,Stop appropriating Harambe's culture.,banging on your chest?,"Oh, I'm sorry, I had no idea that Harambe, the ill-fated gorilla, had an entire culture to appropriate. And here I thought ""banging on my chest"" was a universal way to prove dominance in any situation."

2909,We'll have to get there first!,Or the moon ..holy shit beer on moon,"Oh, because flying to the moon and having a drink is just something we all do every weekend, right? So reasonable. Anyway, it looks like you'll be the first one to figure out how to open a beer on the moon."
2910,"Well, obviously by not vaccinating her child she is helping your child's immune system to fight those diseases, you libtard.","They learned, but because it worked so well, this generation has forgotten about how common it was for your children to die from a disease. Advil won't save you from the measles, polio, and tetanus. I had an argument with a friend over this. She said if my kid isn't vaccinated and yours is, how would they get sick? I tried to explain It makes them resistant not completely immune, but she didn't get it, or didn't want to.","Oh, so now not vaccinating is the new superpower?

2916,And enough will cure polio!,"Scurvy is not *enough* vitamin C, not too much. That's why pirates were known to get scurvy easily, as they typically would not stock fruits on their ships since they spoil too easily. You actually can't overdose on vitamin C, as excess amounts are expelled through urine.","Oh, thank you for enlightening us! So, since pirates were too busy hoarding gold and tiny parrots, they never had enough fresh fruit to prevent scurvy.

2922,Fucking normies,"What puzzles me about r/incels They will make it very clear that they don't like social-justice types. Plenty of people there mock the idea of ""male privilege"" and other basic concepts of the modern left. Yet when you ask them why ""normies"" don't understand them, the usual response goes along the lines of: average men don't repel women, women don't want to admit to themselves they do this, and incels are by definition lonely and disconnected, so they don't show up on mainstream society's view of itself. In short, they are using the theory behind privilege and invisible minorities, that they claim is without merit. I've been asking myself for a while now: is it worth engaging them? I'm sure I can qualify, and I see among them my own worst traits magnified (passivity, fear of coming across wrong, complete blank at society's web of expectations and simply no interest in what passes for ordinary conversation). The odd thing is, there are still plenty of disturbingly misogynistic posts, but the most upvoted comments are the saner ones, suggesting that the place has a demographic of well-adjusted observers (which is not true of any red-pill sub). There seems to be a pattern of: extremists (Caamib, in this case) found the place, it attracts followers who are less committed, they attract more normal people trying to convert the followers. As it is, I'm unsure I can contribute anything. But I wish I could.","Oh, wonderful! Another day, another chance to change the hearts and minds of those poor, marginalized ""normies"" who just can't seem to grasp why they're so rejected by society. I mean, it's not like the incels have any skewed perspectives, unhealthy emotions or a lack of social skills. It's all the fault of those privileged normies, aren't we right? Because everything makes perfect sense on r/incels, and our considerate words just need to break through that dense wall of ignorance."
2923,"As a Target employee, this is why I never ask anyone if they need help.",The guy just looked blankly at the cans of soup,"Oh, absolutely, because when people need help finding canned goods, they should just use their Jedi mind trick to sense them! prioritizing their search skills over basic human interaction, keep slaying it buddy."

I'm shocked that someone could proactively share important information on Reddit, a platform known for its deep and meaningful discussions. Kudos to that individual for turning Reddit into a ticker for game times, truly groundbreaking.""

2933,But did he get his Avatar on the 'high score' screen?,Last night I found an enemy sitting in a house firing his gun at a wall for 10 minutes,"1. Well, it must have taken him forever to get his Avatar on the high score screen, considering his aim was so ""target focused.""

I always thought having a high standard of living, great healthcare, and fair distribution of wealth were all signs of full-blown socialism. My bad, Denmark!

3021,"""Gee Mongolia, why ever would Eastern Europeans not want to be your friends?""","""Already has powerful allies"" modifier when I have no allies... So I can understand why this modifier is in the game, it keeps nations from snowballing and getting tons of huge allies. However it's obvious it does not work, as evident in my Mongolia game. I'm trying to ally with the Commonwealth, however this modifier is giving me a -35 as apparently ""Mongolia already has powerful allies"" This is of course an absolute lie, Uzbek was my only ally the whole game and they rivaled me and broke the alliance hundreds of years ago. The only relations I have are my two vassals, a 1 province Sarig Yogir, and 5 province Tibet. Together they have like 14k troops, hardly what I would consider ""powerful allies"". This is really pissing me off as I'd be able to ally the Commonwealth if it weren't for this, and I really need them as an ally to deal with the Ottoman/ Scandinavian alliance.","Oh fantastic, you're telling me your problem like we couldn't guess! Isn't it always the way: great luck with the Commonwealth, a force to be reckoned with ‚Äì right after they finally realize you're not exactly surrounded by Iranian Resistance."

It's game breaking for the class. It works maybe, 1 out of 5 times.","Oh, absolutely. They've done wonders.

This perk will allow you to store adrenaline past 100%, say up to 125%. As an example as to why this is useful: Currently when in a deaths swiftness it is impossible to do every threshold in your arsenal, however, if you are able to store 125% adrenaline, you can build to 125, ult which uses 90% adren (vigour), adren pot, and immediately have 60% adrenaline while in a deaths swiftness. This allows you to do every thresh you have plus multiple of the same thresholds all within the same deaths swiftness.","1. Oh, wonderful!

It will run, but feel incredibly slow. try it again with 8+ gigs to spare. it's night and day.","Oh, absolutely brilliant!

New players? I'm not saying it's wrong to like these new methods but it's odd compared to the opinions even a few months to a year ago.

3092,Acid rap was an amazing album im sure that had nothing to do with his rise to fame,"Local Chicago artists and rappers I've met believe his dad was instrumental in his rise. Chicago is fucking hard as shit to make it as an artist, partly due to lack of any major label representation. Especially when you're relying on live performances to get noticed. For such a large city, Chicago has a limited number of venues. The city plays a large part in this, mainly through noise restrictions. Even smaller number of venues where rappers can perform. Now because Chance's dad worked for the mayor's office in the past, people suspect he pulled strings that got him the shows he needed to play early on. I have zero evidence of this but after living in Chicago as a performing artist and witnessing first hand how crooked that city is I don't find it hard to believe.","Oh, absolutely! When prodigious talent like Chance's emerges, it's simply the whole city coming together in a giant, coordinated effort to stifle growth and opportunity.

There's also a biological and evolutionary method, basically if you sit still for too long blood begins to pool, veins and arteries are cramped and clenched... So the more you fidget the less of a risk there is for developing a blood clot. Its basically a mini survival instinct. When its cold, fidgeting and shivering causes you to keep warm through movement and keeping your blood circulating. The reason this works is the same reason fidgeting helps you from forming a blood clot.","Oh, wow! You've unlocked the secrets of the universe ‚Äì and you're sharing them with us COMEDY GOLD! You're Darwin's long-lost child, aren't you?"

3101,"Because us wealthy are all evil heartless bastards, thats the only way to succeed in life.",What makes you think that someone who owns such an expensive iron doesn't give to charity?,"1) Oh, sorry, I forgot that owning an expensive iron automatically makes you a heartless shell of a human being, because you know, ironing is the root of all evil. 
2) You may be right, and that iron must have manifested itself on their shelf through a series of highly-strung charity frauds."

Honestly, what would it be about? She was captured as a child and spent her entire life as a slave for Immortan Joe. They might as well make a movie about Nux.","Oh, brilliant idea! Let's totally waste everyone's time with a movie about a child slave who somehow became a kick-ass general. What could possibly be interesting or inspiring about that, right? And don't forget to give some love to Nux - after all, everyone loves a good mindless follower."

2. Wait, were Mike Carey and Jason Cole actually discussing the color of their skin or the number of spots on their apples during their comparison? I never realized reporting and officiating were so codependent with racism or fruit preferences."

2. Oh, great! Now Jesus is going to give gardening tips and start a revolution."
3112,Well in all fairness he did have a picture of the rock....,do you want my rock?,"Oh, so having a picture of The Rock qualifies as being entitled to someone else's rock? Maybe he wants to trade one for the other and start a ""Rock Exchange"" program."
3113,It's not like it's stickied on the front of the page ffs,Doesn't come up,"Oh, well that really puts it into perspective. When a problem ""doesn't come up"" but is particularly crucial that it is stickied on the front page."
3114,Well don't you know that everyone who is anti-Israel or even not 100% pro-Israel is automatically a clear as day raging anti-Semite and a Holocaust denier.,If I called George bush or Barack Obama a war criminal would that mean I'm anti-United States?,"Oh, absolutely! Because expressing concern about Israeli policies or not being overly enthusiastic about them totally makes you an expert on the Holocaust who denies it ever happened. I mean, it's not like you're exercising your right to free speech or anything, right?"

Mining, drilling, excavation, etc. companies want to get the best info to make a profit. If the young earth position was correct, it would be widely taught in schools whose grads would be snapped up by these companies. Instead, they only hire geologists who are taught and do research consistent with an earth that is 4.5 billion years old. Why is it that employment and profitable predictions do not come to young earth geologists at a rate far surpassing the ancient earth geologists? Ask this in a serious, respectful manner (don't be condescending or dismissive.) You want them to think out the answer for themselves.","Oh, I get it! So we should just rely on ~~Pat Robertson~~ Jesus H Christ to guide for-profit companies towards geological research that aligns with ancient teachings. Because, you know, corporations are just brimming with divine wisdom and are more than capable of deciphering complex scientific theories. Or maybe they're just better at staying afloat in this cold, harsh world by following evidence-based research rather than supernatural guides. Your call!"
3142,"I mean, obviously she needs to do her next press conference in a bikini, right?","Also, don't most politicians cover their entire body?","1. Oh, absolutely! Because having clothing on definitely distracts from all the groundbreaking policies they've got brewing. What were we thinking?

3268,You sound pleasant person,"It sucks how I can't be too nice to any men. A rant: Backstory: I'm a vendor that's been working with a restaurant for the past 2 years. Workers there come and go but there's an old man that's been there the entire time. Once, a long time ago, he asked me if I would put songs on a mp3 player for him. I told him ~~hell~~ no and that he needed to learn to use a computer himself, to which he didn't like, but I don't care because I can take or leave the guy. The other day I was getting ready to take off and he comes up to me asking me questions (english isn't his first language and like I said, I can take or leave the guy so I just wanted him to go away the entire time) to which I act friendly enough. He starts feeling my arm, saying I must have big muscles, then he starts trying to pull me in for a kiss. I was at work so I couldn't strangle his stupid ass like I would've liked, but I made it clear he's dead to me. This isn't the first time this has happened. Some men just come to the conclusion that I'd have anything to do with them just because I'm polite. And it's not always old men either, guys have beckoned me over for whatever reason and then have leaned in for a kiss *as* I'm telling them I want nothing to do with them. I should just tell them the truth, I'd never consider dating an old man. I think old men are disgusting. They should stick with women their own age. Young women who are into old men have issues or they want their money when they die. Old, broke-ass men that chase after young women are fucking pathetic. No guy, I don't want to get to know you, I don't even want to expend the energy it would take to remember your name. I'd rather go back to before I was burdened with your existence, I miss that, please let me relive that time once again. I swear to all that's holy, I take the time to make myself look as ratchet as possible and I *still* can't get men to leave me alone. I could cover myself with literal feces and will still get hit on by at least one fucking homeless guy. What do I have to do?!? I don't want to assume every man is like that because it's not true. But when I have to look at the ground everywhere I go because merely making eye contact for even one second is enough to get me followed around an entire grocery store (and I see you, motherfucker, you think you're slick but you're as plain as day, do you think I'm stupid or blind?!) what choice do I have but to put up my defenses? I need a really big fucking dog to take around with me or something...","Oh, you poor soul. To think you're stuck in this eternal struggle of politeness and dealing with the unwanted advances of men.

3297,But the stats say our defense is top 10,"Living in the past, again, forever into the future I posted this in the offseason, looks like it's playing out perfectly again. Last year I was so hyped, and we all felt the same for good reason. Team had played well before...if Randall and DMC could be ok, and if our defense could be just as good as it was (not very good) then there was no reason to think we wouldn't be a pretty damn good team with a nice shot to do well in the playoffs! I remember posting on here, that NOTHING matters if Romo goes down. Well low and behold, Romo goes down and our team falls apart and we have the worst season in recent memory. Our defense was about as crappy as we felt it would be, our running game was pretty damn good as we hoped it would be. So w hy did we suck so hard? We can't close out teams, and even in 2014, we haven't been able to close out a team with our defense for damn near as long as I can remember. In 2014, Romo got us leads and Demarco closed them out. And if that didn't happen, we could always count on Romo to bring us back and give us a chance for that FG or game winning TD IF we got the last possesion. Please note that's our offense: getting us leads closing out games and/or bringing us back from the brink. Our defense rarely ever makes game changing plays when we need them. Because this teams defense SUCKS DICKS at closing out games when we have a lead. I had a feeling that every time we are up by less than 8, and the opponent gets the ball in a situation where they will have the last possession, we're done. We cant' get any pressure on the QB, and in no huddle 2 minute drill it's just way to much pressure on our extremely below average defense to hold onto that lead. We saw it last year in OT 2 times. Neither time did the offense even get on the field and we lost. Reddit and PFF to the rescue here is the data since 2011 in the scenario where the Cowboys are either tied or ahead by less than 8 with 4 minutes to go in the 4th quarter. Dallas has allowed the most TDs in that time with 12. The Vikings have allowed the most total scoring plays with 21 Dallas has lost more games than any other team in the league in this scenario with 15 losses since 2011. That's out of 31 opportunities, which is 48.39% of the time. That's almost a full season worth of losses because our defense can't stop the opponent when it matters most. and in that time, Dallas has the worst percentage of all NFL teams. So with all that being said, looking at our current roster, what reasons do I have to believe our defense is better now at getting press ure and sealing wins. With Romo, there are games we'll win even though the defense gives up points at the end of games as long as there is SOME time left for him to use his magic. But if he goes down, and he probably will at some point, we're doomed. I do believe if we have Romo, and Elliot playing well that we can close out games using our offense, but that's such a damn risky proposition. Because your a one trick pony at that point, and if that pony gets hurt in any significant way, again, we're doomed. ..discuss","Oh wow, a historical analysis of your team's failures! I'm sure everyone was waiting with bated breath for this moment. You've really exposed the shortcomings of your team's defense by mentioning their terrible performance over three seasons. It's great to see such critical thinking and thorough research, really just grinding out every tiny flaw. I mean, appreciate the enthusiasm right?"

One of the major flaws of the flintlock design is that you have to rely on there being powder outside of the weapon, and you have to rely on the frizzen to keep it in place. A problem with this a lot of people discovered the hard way is that after a vigorous activity like climbing a tree, riding a horse, or clubbing someone with the gun the frizzen can swing open. Even if it barely opens up the powder inside the pan can spill out. So if you have it completely loaded, ready to go, and you swing it, the frizzen could open up, and spill your powder leaving the gun unable to fire.","""Wow, it's comforting to know that our weapons are so finicky they need to be treated with kid gloves.

My current company has health insurance at a good rate, but if I sign up for the family plan, it ends up taking about 25% of my paycheck which would be extremely unaffordable.

You can 'win' in terms of mana and tempo if you have a good follow up but Ooze only really fits into control decks and in control vs control it often doesn't do as much as people think it does even when it destroys a weapon, Atiesh or otherwise.

Then one day an atheist (who's name passes me) asked a simple question: **Here's the argument:** When the devil disobeyed god, god damned him. Damning, meaning the devil will never be allowed into heaven. Then how the hell did the devil sneak back into heaven to trick Adam and Eve? Was God unaware? Was he too weak to guard his borders? What kind of God can't back his own word? This is where I started to logically question all the things I was told, the stories always fell apart when you applied logic. Now, I'm not sure if that particular story has an actual answer or if it is solid. Was the devil waiting for his damnation to be processed by bureaucratic angels? Who knows?

I fell in love with both of them and soon found myself panicking if I left my watch at home. They helped me drastically reduce the number of times I pulled out my phone and completely erased my ""what if they responded"" anxiety. So when I bought an Apple Watch during a very impulsive binge shopping spree, I figured I'd just try it out and return it. Figured the complaints about the battery life and slowness would immediately turn me off. Well, I was wrong. I fell in love with it, hard. The number of very useful apps for things I already used on my phone was amazing, and I found the health features to be more helpful for me. I'm not saying the Apple Watch is objectively better than Pebble. It's going to come down to personal preference. If you want something basic that stays out of the way and keeps things simple, Pebble is fantastic for that. For me, I appreciate the interaction options with Apple notifications and being able to quickly give input to certain apps. And I've made use of Siri and receiving calls directly on the Watch far more than I thought I would. So Pebble, it's been fun, and I may eventually be back. For now, though, I'm jumping ship. On a side note, I will be selling my silver/white PTR (smaller size). There is a slight scuff on the screen (just looks like a tiny smudge) but otherwise clean. I have both the red leather band (looks worn) and the silver mesh Pebble band.

3701,You mean we as a community shouldn't ask for reparations?,"Yes. Do not push further, as SJWs do, asking plumbing companies to introduce sensitivity seminars.","Oh, the horror! Who knew that asking for basic human decency in the form of sensitivity seminars would topple society as we know it? Let's just hope the plumbers don't rise up and demand respect for their craft too."
3702,tbh ireallydgaf he sucks i don't look like an idiot misspelling it,*Barry*,"Oh, you took the time to really spell out everything in acronyms and text talk? To be honest, I could really use a lesson in subtlety and intelligence."
3703,We need to fund more of the DEA to control the situation!,"Just yesterday, there were 7 heroin/fentanyl related deaths in ONE COUNTY in Ohio. All the while, Insys Therapeutics, which sells fentanyl, is spending $500k to convince people in AZ that weed is the real danger. It's time to fight back, folks. People are dying. Register to vote. Links in comments.","Oh, absolutely, let's throw more money at the DEA. I'm pretty sure their track record of fixing drug-related problems has been nothing but successful so far. And why stop at funding? Maybe we should give them a raise, too?"
3704,How dare members of the sport's media dedicate their time towards being sports media.,"In this week's edition of ""Shit Utter Says"", he goes after his colleagues","Oh, how absolutely shocking that someone working in sports media is dedicating their time to that very thing!

He recently said in an interview that he still watches SNL and when asked what he thought of it said ""I don't like agenda comedy. I guess I could say that.""","Oh, absolutely. Saturday Night Dead? That's happened way before my time. I mean, by the late 90s, SNL basically turned into a dusty relic meant to entertain cavemen. Who's even laughing at that rock they're chipping away anyway?"
3708,"Moderators, not fact checkers.","and the moderator will say, ok next question.","Moderators, not fact checkers? That's right, because we can't let the truth get in the way of some hilarious Q&A."

3710,It's easy to get confused given that there are so many popular Buddhist temples in Malaysia with all the hilltribe kids hanging around.,"Going by OP's comments, he clearly isn't the brightest bulb in the box either. Apparently he originally said that the watch went missing in Malaysia until someone pointed out that Wat Doi Suthep is in Thailand.","Oh, absolutely. Whenever I'm lost in the midst of the hilltribe kids, I always check Wat Doi Suthep to make sure my watch is still on my wrist. It's like my personal GPS."

So I went down there and talked to the nurse, and she's asking about my sex life, because that's what they do, and I told her straight up that I have never had sex. She's a professional, of course, so all she said was ""oh, so you're *really* unlikely to have HIV."" So I told her I was just wondering what it was like to get the test. I could tell she was curious, though. She wanted the story, and she wasn't going to get it. Anyway, I don't have HIV. So that's cool.","Oh wow, you must be an actual superhero then for dodging HIV and wasting that nurse's time with your wild denial stories. Just imagine, the backstories you could've come up with if you actually had HIV. Saving the day one contrarian at a time."
3716,You're disrespecting the greatness that is David Arquette,"Rey Misterio Jr wasn't a highlight of late WCW. There was no highlights of late WCW. Minecraft is still entertaining 85% of the time, WCW was never entertaining in its final years.","Oh, absolutely! David Arquette saving the wrestling world single-handedly was WCW's true saving grace.

3722,We work in this country not take two week vacations.,Brit here we use every other week more than fortnightly but if you went away on vacation for 2 weeks would you say I'm going away for 2 weeks or for a fortnight?,"Oh, I see, so we shouldn't take vacations in our own country since we're so fond of using every other week as a measure of time?

3723,You can always talent out of one of the best CD's in the game to get burning rush!,"The effects were only for PvE.

Because nothing says ""I'm a helpful support class"" like sacrificing your own durability for a quick escape. But hey, at least we'll have more time to watch our health bars plummet. Thanks, dev team!"
3724,But Buu killed Dabura,Unless you invoke satan and a puppy.,"Oh, I get it! It's so simple now ‚Äì all you need is to summon Satan and a puppy to justify every action. Masterful sarcasm, really!"

3727,BECAUSE YOU'RE A FILTHY PIRATE!,"If I copy a 30GB video file back and forth from one computer on my home network to another, why doesn't that cost me anything?","Oh, I get it! You're assuming I'm a pirate because I can manage a HD video transfer without breaking the bank. I guess we all can be pirates now, huh?"
3728,Well they were obvious beta cucks,"I'm from Taiwan. Our last last president, male, went to prison for corruption. Our last president, also male, finished his second term with an approval rating of 9 percent.","Oh, absolutely, let's just blame it on the beta cucks. After all, how else can we explain a well-functioning democracy and accountability of leaders in a country that's not some backward, misogynistic hellhole?"
3729,I build crit on Loki,"Certain Items on Certain Gods Does anyone not build a certain item on some god just cuz it looks funny? I usually get a lifesteal item on agni, but i HATE building them because they look funny with the rest of the items. *they arent blue* its just me probably, but it really bothers me.","1. Oh, absolutely! Just like how I can't sleep at night knowing I'm not building crit on Loki. It's the small things in life, you know?

3730,But they neeeed male guardianship to save them from their sexual urges,"Well, it has to start somewhere. Even if this fails, it will enlighten more people for the next attempt. ""guardianship"" was invented by the Saudis only in the 1980s but of course that means there is a whole generation now that has never known any other way. Maybe one-day Saudi women will even be allowed to ride bicycles or drive, imagine that. But ending the insanity of guardianship for an adult is at least a start.","Well, let's just thank our stars that Saudi women have someone to safeguard them from their own hands - oh wait, never mind. Maybe one day they'll also be allowed to vote, now that's a thought!"
3731,"oh hi there, mr EVGA rep, can you send me a 1060?","Even though the 1060 SC (it doesn't mean ""short card"", seriously) is the same general size as the 750/750ti, the plates aren't compatible. At this time, we don't have plans to offer separate backplates for the 10 series.","""Well, thank you, EVGA rep, for confirming what I already know - that you don't care about my graphics card needs. Can't wait to see that separate backplate in a galaxy far, far away."""
3732,But... we're the worst 3-0 team...,The Ravens are the top-graded team overall by @PFF after the first three weeks.,"Oh, amazing! Because being the worst 3-0 team is exactly what we all strive for. It's nice to know we're setting such a high bar for everyone else."
3733,"OMG, why can't you treat a woman with RESPECT?","I live in a college town, can confirm.","1. Oh, I'm absolutely appalled. It's not like these esteemed institutions of higher learning have ever taught anyone how to treat a woman with respect.
2. I know, right? Here I thought the entire purpose of going to college is to learn how to treat women like perfect, untouchable beings, but I guess I was wrong."
3734,"No, there are actually flies that are only 0.0038um tall.",In this case the fly height is referring to the reader height above the disk?,"Oh great, now I have to picture a fly with a ruler trying to measure people's height above their disks. What's next, ants chin-checking each other over dishwasher debates?"
3735,"Oh dear, this one poor Wal-Mart!",Walmart is just killing it with the displays,"1. ""Oh dear? That poor Wal-Mart is struggling so hard to dominate with their killer displays, truly heart-wrenching.""
2. ""Yeah, the grim fate of the poor Wal-Mart is just too much to bear; they're just barely surviving by 'killing it' with their displays."""
3736,"But Lil Exorcist was definitely a good hardcounter to Undertaker, bro.","When has the meta ever been fixed by player exploration? They say this every time, they release supposed counter cards...and then they inevitably have to nerf the oppressive deck.","Oh, absolutely. Whenever Wizards of the Coast releases a new set, I'm always like, ""This time they totally fixed the meta!"" And then I wake up a few months later to find the same couple decks dominating the scene. I guess they never learn."
3737,"Yeah, then the fucks in NC take credit when the Wrights were OH boys at heart.","It sort of does? Like if the Wright brothers were Polish guys that immigrated to the US and still launched an airplane, I'd still call it an American invention.","""Oh, absolutely! Because claiming they were Ohio boys at heart really justifies their status as American innovators. All hail the North Carolinian superheroes who took credit for their achievements.""

""Well, you know, without the incredible contributions of the proud North Carolinians, the Wrights might have struggled to lift their revolutionary invention off the ground. We truly owe them so much."""
3738,You forgot your,Clinton isn't even on the top 100 worst American politicians. This double standard is absurd.,"Thank you for pointing that out, really enlightening to hear that Clinton is like 99th on the list of terrible U.S. politicians! How have I managed to survive this long without knowing?"
3739,"Get two local guys, dress them up as Trump &amp; Clinton and put them in a 10 minute match.",Save RAW: The Thread,"1. Oh wow, brilliant idea! Because nothing says high-quality entertainment like two grown men dressed as caricatures of political figures wrestling for our amusement.

2. Yeah, why not defame two men and degrade professional wrestling altogether, all in the name of saving Raw: The Thread. Absolutely genius."
3740,You sound like a well-informed voter.,"Not a very good pool of selection, but I'd rather get some pompous ahole over a murdering psycho death rattler who yells racism against anyone who doesn't share her views.","Oh fantastic, someone's been reading Wikipedia and thinks they're an expert on world peace.

3741,Maybe if I identify as trans-swole I can get an endocrinologist to hook me up.,Hey all you have to do is be a gender bender and they will hook you up with test,"Oh, absolutely! All it takes is changing your gender fluctuations to muscle mass alterations, and presto, the doctors will jump at the chance to inject you with testosterone like there's no tomorrow. Because medical professionals have nothing better to do than cater to people demanding instant body transformations."
3742,"It's simple, they just make it first-person",I can't picture Diablo in VR.,"1. Oh, I see! It's not like VR technologists have been working tirelessly to get a grip on immersive experiences or anything.
2. Yeah, because we all know VR technology is just a big joke and not a serious field. Classic oversight."
3743,Well at least he's had a respectable afterlife.,mummy in Mexican museum,"Oh, absolutely, nothing is more respectable than being a mummified exhibit in a museum! People come from all around to admire your afterlife success."

3746,"Nah, obviously Nuremberg was an assault on Nazi leaders' human rights!","I voted against this on the grounds that the military should be exempt during times of war, but overall this is an important step forward for the county. There are always cases where guilt is without doubt and the crime is so heinous that it's a natural reaction to think ""this person deserves to be executed"". But data has shown us the unequal way in which the death penalty is applied and so this Amendment makes our justice system more fair and equitable. Congratulations to everyone who supported this effort.","Oh, absolutely! It's not like the Nuremberg trials were just a well-reasoned and necessary response to the atrocities committed during WWII. Nope, it was all an attack on the human rights of those poor, innocent Nazis. What a tireless campaign for just cause you've managed here, making sure our justice system remains as fair and equitable as possible, despite those pesky data hinting at its unequal nature. Bravo, indeed."
3747,"Oh goodie, 10ah pouch cells out of shenzen.","This factory in China makes you custom Lipos. Haven't tested them but might be an option for some of you, they look really legit.","Oh wow, talk about a revelation! And who knew China had such a reliable source for custom Lipos? Because I've always thought they specialize in some other kind of batteries..."
3748,You could mug him the next time he wears it,"Someone was wearing this shirt in my class today. Anyone know where to find it? (Could only get this angle, he left shortly after)","1. Oh, brilliant investigation skills! You'd make Sherlock Holmes proud with your ""he left shortly after"" clue. 
2. You're quite the detective, really. Apprehending a shirt-wearing suspect while wearing invisible undergarments must have been quite the challenge."
3749,"Now I know why I had a blackout yesterday.... ~~Staph stealing my bulbs for ideas dammit.~~ Besides that was an increased rate for smooth stone, so no you didn't get it",When the increased drop rates are on point,"""Wow, thank you for enlightening me.

3751,AWW DUDE CMON ITS JUST A LIL SMALL TINY MISTAKE I MEAN IT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE AM I RIGHT?,THAT'S FOR FUCKING SURE SHILLARY,"1. Oh, absolutely! Because when I accidentally nuke a city, it's just a ""lil small tiny mistake"", right? Right?

Just what people have been clamoring for - a 3-person pit crew in NASCAR. Next they'll be saying the driver needs to change the tires too.

3753,"But Kyle likes Trump, so I think Trump won.",Trump reminded me of Shoenice. Rambling. Clinton certainly won.,"Oh, I see, so anyone who likes Trump must be an expert political analyst, right? And comparing Trump to Shoenice only solidifies your accurate prediction that Clinton totally won. Brilliant logic, really."
3754,"Danny Woodhead, Julian Edelman, Toby Gerhardt, Wes Welker, etc.","Who does Christian McCaffrey remind you of? I'm a big McCaffrey fan and love watching him run. That being said, I couldn't think of a great comparison of his running style. He's got great burst and shake and is awesome as a receiver out of the backfield. The closest comparison I could think of was Marshall Faulk, but that doesn't seem perfect. Who am I forgetting?","Oh, calm down, Albert Einstein over here! Comparing Christian McCaffrey to a chocolate teapot would have been more appropriate. Because let's face it, once you've seen one running back, you've seen them all!"
3755,But it looks so cool!,"Vaping if you don't smoke It's expensive and pointless especially if your vaping 0mg juice. Vaping is very useful and a much better alternative to smoking BUT if you didn't smoke in the first place, there is no need to start a potentially addictive hobby. I've seen non-smokers start vaping with 0mg juice and start using 12mg juice 3 months later.","Oh great, another convert to the only hobby designed to make you regret not being lactose intolergent."
3756,I too would like the double barrel to be purely better than the water-pipe and pump shotgun in close quarters.,Suggestion: you should be able to shoot both barrels of the double barrel shotgun at the same time,"Oh, absolutely brilliant! Because nothing beats blasting both barrels and immediately reloading in the middle of a heart-pounding intense gunfight. *eye roll*"
3757,"He had such a great ""temperament""",I saw him yelling at his staff. I sure hope he had a tabloid style breakdown and extends his embarrassment.,"Oh, so ""temperament"" means publicly humiliating those around you? Count me in, I can't wait for his next tabloid meltdown!"

N lets be honest......I'm probably far from only one. ^ _ ^,"Oh, absolutely, nothing screams 'amazing game experience' like grinding the same content for an entire week, non-stop. Can't wait for Arc 3 to feel the same overwhelming joy! *throws confetti*"
3759,they bought it fair and square from the dude in the field on the ATV...,Okay... which one of you gave the North Koreans a Thunderbird?,"1. Oh, so let me get this straight, you're implying that these guys are secret arms dealers who sell Thunderbirds to North Korea? Wow, I had no idea that John Deere salespeople were in such high demand by dictators.

2. Well, I'll be damned. In all my years of watching the news, I never thought I'd hear that the guy on the ATV down the road is an arms dealer mastermind, supplying nuclear aircraft to countries that still use ox-drawn ploughs."

3761,Cuz a half game lead is totally safe and awesome.,"Given that the Giants didn't play today and that the Cards had 15 runs dropped on them by the Reds, I doubt any of them care in the slightest.","Oh yeah, because when a team lets 15 runs slip through their fingers, they immediately forget all their struggles and become blissfully indifferent. Can't blame them though, it's not like leading by a half game ever made anyone nervous or competitive."

I don't understand why mine is 152 GB in size!!!,"Oh, absolutely! It's not like PokerStars has a secretBitcoinMiningForce1337 or anything. That would be just too ridiculous to happen right in the background while you're trying to play cards."
3763,Should've added an,GOG doesn't seem all that shady to me.,"1. Oh, definitely! Can't forget to appreciate how GOG manages to combine honesty, transparency, and shadiness in such a delightful way.

3766,Yea took me so long getting used to Sir Alex.,"Whatever it is, you get used to it. It's the same with most managers that speak English as a second language.

It must have taken you years to adjust to Sir Alex's language skills. In fact, I may start doing crossword puzzles to challenge my brain now.""

Science has been searching for these answers for centuries, but it's so obvious now, isn't it? Bravo, dear internet-sleuths!"
3768,Are you telling me this is an airshow stunt?,It's airshow stunt bro,"Oh wow, I had no idea that gravity is just a suggestion during airshow stunts! I guess anything is possible if you're brave enough to ignore the laws of physics."

3770,But AK-47 is more accurate and do more damage,"I grew up playing counter strike, currently on the swat team for my county. Can confirm this is an accurate statement. Remember kids, never choose terrorists. It's not cool to have an AK-47.","Oh, absolutely, if you're getting into a firefight and you decide to be a terrorist just for kicks, an AK-47 is definitely the way to go.

3775,I'm sure that proselytizing without your name tags really helped....,"I was also in Chile, Vina del Mar, when 9/11 happened. I had been there for 2 months and we were having our zone meeting that morning. When my companion and I got to the church building in downtown Valparaiso only the first plane had hit. Our entire zone was huddled around a little TV, probably thinking it was an accident, when the second tower got hit. The rest of the day is a blur, but for a couple weeks following the attack we were instructed to proselytize without our name tags on. We didn't get any grief from Chileans on the streets or from members. Our mission president was a good person, but didn't have a lot to say about the tragedy. It was supposed to be just business as usual.","Oh, absolutely. It must have been so challenging to go about spreading your message without those identifying name tags. I'm sure the people of Chile had no idea that a Mormon mission was happening right under their noses."

I bought low and I sold high, this is how you operate a business, which is what I was doing at the time.

If you really want to up the Trump then you throw in a little dig at the end, ""it's people like your friends at Goldman Sachs who were responsible for the housing collapse and the subsequent recession, not me. All I did was try and make the best of a bad situation."" But nope. ""That's called business."" The man is just so bad at thinking on his feet.","Ah, so the secret to successfully navigating a complex financial crisis is just having a bunch of advisors to help you ""think on your feet""?

3781,get the fuck outta here with ur stupid opinions man weed is all I need,heroin,"Oh, I see you're well-informed, buddy. You know, heroin is just a more advanced form of weed.

What do you think makes him look like a cholo?,"Oh, I see. Because a name like ""Alvarez"" instantly translates to ""hardened street gang member"" in today's world.

3803,Transgender people would not exist if there were no gender roles.,"Transgender isn't about gender roles, right? Everywhere I go it seems people keep basing transgender dysphoria off of feminine/masculine personality traits or traditional gender roles in order to invalidate transgender people, but what I keep basing it off is what you'd prefer your body to look like and/or which community you feel best represented by or comfortable with. Seeing people saying that because they play sports but don't identify as male or they can wear dresses but don't need to be a transwoman means transgender people are just silly and don't exist keeps bothering me - I feel sometimes the majority must be right and I'm just stupid but surely the people saying transgender people aren't right must be wrong, right?

Must be some kind of cosmic joke."
3806,we need Trump to really show Putin what's-what.,"This will go down as one of the biggest failures of the Obama Administration and NATO in the early 20th century. Not only did Russia get away with invading a country and taking the only part they have a strategic interest in (Crimea) , not only did they arm mal contents to create an illegal buffer state in Eastern Ukraine but they also shot down a plane full of people from a NATO member state. And what did the west do? Absolutely nothing. We didn't even arm the Ukranians. We sat back and scolded Russia and imposed some sanctions that did nothing. Putin has free reign to do as he wishes. Why? Because the west is full of absolutely spineless leaders.","Oh, great! We definitely need Trump to step in and scare Putin with his extensive knowledge of foreign policy and diplomacy.

2. Well, some people like Pickerel over Swordfish, can't argue with that logic!"
3816,That'll show the establishment!,"Depends on where you live. If you live in a ""non-battleground"" state, your individual vote on the federal level means very little.

Sometimes we see TSM members eating bananas between two games...,"1. Wow, who would've thought that miserable esports athletes might need something basic like food? Maybe Riot should consider sponsoring some biscuits as well, you know, for their survival.
2. Surely, the world of esports is just one massive lucrative scheme to spend billions on fancy gaming chairs and random bananas. Wouldn't want these players to die from malnutrition, now, would we?"
3853,Well magic online prize structure was too calculated before we gotta add some randomness too it,"This is the online equivalent of a store offering prize packs for fnm instead of store credit. It's a cash grab for the company that forces the player to keep investing more money because instead of getting packs that can be sold for tickets that can be used to buy singles or enter leagues instead a player has to hope he opens one of the few ""modern rare/mythics"" that are actually worth anything. Just another cost on top of an already expensive and poorly maintained digital product.","Oh wow, thanks for enlightening us. We totally didn't realize that adding randomness was just a sneaky way for the company to make even more money.

3863,"Yea, just let the banks fail and America would be fine and the financial crisis would be averted!","Well our government is heavily involved in banking. They basically told them that they could give out as many shitty loans as they wanted because when shit hit the fan, they would get bailed out. It's welfare. So a person or company that knows they have no financial consequence for risky and poor business decisions is going to make different decisions than if their mistakes need to be paid for out of their own pockets. They should've let them fail. In terms of oil, at this point regardless of all the green energy in the world, we still need oil. Hopefully not forever, but for the time being we need them. Honestly the oil company topic is difficult because of how heavily politicized it is, like many issues. It's so hard to find information presented without a political bias, and it's more difficult when people don't disclose their bias and present it as neutral, when it certainly is not.","Oh, absolutely, letting banks fail would have made everything perfect and the financial crisis would simply disappear into thin air! And don't forget, we're doing great with green energy, but let's not forget we still need oil, especially when everyone's agendas are so heavily politicized, making it impossible to find neutral information."

Use some of the taxes to fund treatment programs for adults who want them. This will put all drug gangs out of business and greatly reduce crime. The concept of treating grown adults as idiots when it comes to intoxicants is relatively new and grew out of that other failed experiment, prohibition of alcohol. Ideally no-one would use drugs or use only the more innocuous ones like weed and mescaline - people should be able to make that choice themselves without funding criminals and without further risking their lives over QC issues and with vast amounts of extra taxation for the government which could be put to good use.","Oh, absolutely.

Going to the region dropdown menu and choosing ""non-EU"" while laughing at the EU peasants with their dumb taxes was my favorite thing about online shopping. Why is the government taking away my fun? What are we, Germany? On a more serious note: I get the fact that this is a move to help out Swiss businesses, but patriotism doesn't incline me to pay more for the same product just because I'm buying it in Switzerland. Maybe, just maybe, instead of making me want to shop online less, make me want to buy domestically more? You know, better service, higher quality, unique products and otherwise innovating a.k.a. adapting to the economy? No? You're going to sit on your ass and demand a 400% tax on Chinese imports to make Swiss electronics manufacturing more competitive? Ok.","Wow, I had no idea the Swiss had such a predilection for ancient Chinese arithmetic. In fact, I always thought a 400% tax hike on Chinese imports would require at least a bit of Russian roulette-style innovation from the Swiss electronics industry. But hey, who am I to judge?

Having Keegan-Michael Key actually be his anger translator (while not-so-subtly chewing out republicans for stonewalling on climate change), showing the opening of *The Lion King* as ""video evidence of [his] birth"" (while embarrassing Donald Trump until the man just sat there sulking, impotent rage in his eyes), rubbing the republicans' collective noses in his electoral victories during the State of the Union Address... Man, he is the coolest president we have ever had in a lot of ways.","1. Wow, I totally forgot that all those united Americans and feelings of safety and pride were just a mirage.

The thing exploded, and my scissors flew out of my hand, cutting me badly enough to go to the ER.","Oh, wow, great job there! So now you've got a first-rate story about your time in the ER because, you know, liquid-filled balls are just asking to be stuck together with scissors.

3946,I can't find the,"Grade should probably do some research before ranting about how stupid things are I unsubscribed because it looks like every other video is just Grade ranting about shit he doesn't really understand. I used to love him, but it's kinda hard to watch videos about some guy calling something stupid when he clearly doesn't know what he's talking about. For example, the animals video. He mentions how it's stupid that Crocodiles and Alligators are a different species, same for Coyotes, Foxes, Jackals, and Wolves, but that dogs are all the same species. That's not how it works. And in the phobia video, he says that phobias are dumb because being afraid of spiders is rational really misses the point. If phobias are irrational, and something you think is a phobia is rational, *then maybe it's not a phobia*. A phobia isn't not going in your bathtub because there's a spider in there and they're spooky, it's like not going home because there's nobody on guard for spiders and a spider might have found there way in there, even though there's no reason to believe one did or that it'll disrupt anything. That's not all! Then there's the alphabet one, the one with the letters &amp; numbers that mentions vitamins, the autocorrect one all coming off as stupid. And then there are others that while not as bad as those, aren't perfect either. I feel like there's gonna be comments on how I'm being super pretentious and shit, but I'm really not. All I'm saying is maybe don't do topics that you don't know anything about so you look like less of an idiot.

There's nothing like the true humiliation of being forced to do something with a group of people who are angry at you.,"Oh wow, that'll teach him to express his bigoted views in a crowded bar! It's just so much better when he gets escorted out by a diverse group of people who are furious at him. Talk about a reality check!"
4073,But you only have a 5% chance of staying there.,"It still blows my mind to look at charts like that and see that I'm in the ""normal"" category. This time 18 months ago I'd have been well in to the ""obese"" category. Funnily enough I managed to move down these categories by eating less... like magic...","Oh, absolutely groundbreaking information! If only someone hadn't already figured out that consuming fewer calories would lead to weight loss. You're truly on the edge of a revelation here."
4074,Racism is funny!,we wuz warr heruuusss 'n' shieeeet,"Oh, absolutely, ""we wuz warriors"" and ""we were so badass, we even imported racism from your dumb ancestors who couldn't figure it out on their own!"" You got your hilarious joke and plenty of work to do on empathy."
4075,Git gud,I find them to be about the same length,"1. ""Oh wow, nice burn there! You've truly uncovered the secret that length and skill are interchangeable, thanks for sharing!""

2. ""You're absolutely right, I should have known that mastering something overnight is as difficult as writing a novel. Let's all applaud this groundbreaking revelation!"""
4076,"Clearly you are very against spending time replying to comments that you don't need to reply to, so this argument makes a lot of sense.","That's not what I said at all though is it? I said it takes less than five minutes to google something, then you don't end up posting something that's incorrect and someone has to spend time correcting you for getting something wrong. I'm not against having a conversation, I never said that at all, I'm just saying don't whine when people correct you, because you were too lazy to google something in the first place.","Oh, absolutely! Carry on with your ridiculous assumptions. Because, you know, correcting someone's mistakes is the same as being against conversation. Sure, buddy. I bet you're an outstanding team player."
4077,You forgot the,"Feminists want more ""equality"" for all! Especially a place for men to talk about their horribly abusive tendencies and a place for smart better-than-men wemon to help them.","Oh, absolutely! You know, the place for enlightened gentlemen to discuss their fragile masculinity and the special section for strong, independent women to empower them with their superior intellect. Just what the world needs!"
4078,Always drop the,did my sarcasm not read? shit,"1. ""Oh, absolutely! Because nothing completes a sarcastic statement like a good old 'did my sarcasm not read?' follow-up.""
2. ""I see you're looking for a direct translation of your sarcasm into written text. It must be difficult to stay that polite in such a formal environment."""
4079,Would you rather have a cunt talking to you in your head?,A fucking dick. I really hate that guy.,"1. Oh, fantastic! Because there's literally nothing more entertaining than arguing about who has the superior genitalia in their head. Let's all just stop everything and focus on that profound discussion!

Now you just have to buy the parts with the coolest names.","You truly have a gift for deciphering what makes a product perform better, dear friend. If only we could all harness this level of intellect."
4081,"Knowing Americans, it would have to speak English and love Jesus.",How intelligent would life have to be on another planet for us to question the moral implications of exploring it?,"1. Oh, great! Just what we need: a planet with super-high intelligence that only speaks Klingon and worships Vulcans. What a total letdown!
2. I hear there's this far-off world where the beings evolved to be brilliant, but they only communicate through telepathy and don't believe in any higher power. Honestly, we'd probably just bore them to death."
4082,"Yeah, I mean look what happened to Britton last night ... oh wait, they forgot to use him","I'm of the mindset that none of this matters come playoff time. Pitching/hitting splits against specific pitchers/batters, home/away, how ever else you wanna slice it doesn't matter when it comes to the playoffs. Its a whole new season. I've been watching baseball for a while now (probably short in comparison to some of the older guys/gals on this sub), and I have seen the most unlikely heroes step up in a time of need. In the 2004 ALCS, I remember the ridiculous splits Mariano had when entering the 9th with a lead, and look how that ended up. So I like to think that anyone can step up or fall of a cliff come October. Go Sox.","Wow, isn't it just amazing how a guy like Britton can go from being a world-class closer one day to a completely forgettable figure the next? It's almost like he's subject to the same unpredictability as the rest of us mere mortals. Enjoy your wild playoff rides, folks, because who knows, you might be the next unlikely hero or victim!"
4083,You'd be surprised at the long intellectual tradition and widely varying schools of thought on clowning,"Also there's a huge culture around clowns, clowns aren't just ""people in clown clothes that tell jokes"", most of them come from clown schools/traditions.","Oh wow, I had no idea that the world of clowning was so deep and thought-provoking. I mean, I always thought they just popped out of clown vending machines."
4084,parent,Maybe they're finally listening to their parents about playing outside more,"""Oh great, now they're finally listening to their parents and playing outside more. I guess that means we'll be able to hear their screams from a distance now."""
4085,Campaign of insults!,It's so funny how most of the Clinton ads are just repeating things Trump and now Pence said. They're their own worst enemy.,"Oh, absolutely. Just like a magnificent orchestra playing the sweetest symphony, Clinton's team must have spent hours meticulously crafting those insult-filled masterpieces. How could we ever forget that unforgettable moment when they accidentally used Trump's own words against him? Truly, they're a genius both in insulting themselves and in warning others to stay away from sharp pointed objects."
4086,But WP isn't dead,B2X takes over worldwide customer care for Microsoft's Lumia and feature phones,"1. Ah, so if we're giving out participation trophies today, then Windows Phone definitely deserves one for kicking the bucket while someone else steps up to handle their old customers!
2. It's heartwarming to see Windows Phone is still alive, just being handled by a completely different team now, because that's always a solid business strategy!"
4087,You should buy a bigger home,"Personally, microwave ovens without a mute button. Why don't they all have a mute button? If I wanna nuke something at night/during my kids' nap time, I risk waking them up with that piercing beeping.","Well, since you're so concerned about my home size, I'll just get a bigger microwave to fit in my small house. And I'll be sure to yell ""hello, giant microwave!"" every time I use it to silence the beeping."
4088,Your sister looks thrilled.,"I was trying to be cool by flipping off the camera, but my mother told me to change it into the peace sign","1. ""Oh, absolutely. She's just overjoyed at the sight of your pathetic attempt to be edgy.""
2. ""Spreading joy and positivity one peace sign at a time, thanks for noticing."""
4089,Good point.,Incorrect,"1. Yeah, because nothing says ""owning the debate"" quite like sarcastic agreeance. Brilliant.
2. Well, thank you for pointing out the obvious ‚Äì it's not like anyone else has ever noticed that before."
4090,"Hey, it could also be a legitimate job like door knocking",pretty much bang on with this,"Line 1: Oh great, thanks for enlightening me that banging on doors is now considered a prestigious career move. 

Line 2: Wow, you've truly put me in my place with that highly informative comment about my life choices."
4091,Hamilton bias,Do you even F1? Seen at the offical F1 store,"Oh, I'm sure you know everything about F1 because you bought a souvenir from the store. People must be in awe of your knowledge."
4092,"yes only muslims, blacks and mexicans are facing racism, Whites and asians dont face it.","Asians are considered ""white"" since they're not ""oppressed"".","Well, it's comforting to know that Asians are finally becoming White, because nobody wants to be oppressed, right? #whiteprivilege #sarcasmoverload"
4093,Guys this is so fucking fun!,Embracing American culture,"I could definitely see it. You've mastered the art of making joyful parades, fireworks, and baseball games seem like the epitome of excitement!"

Nevertheless, we should keep stocking up on that dangerous inventory; promoting medical emergencies left and right!""   
2. ""Oh, the tragedy! Here I am ruining everyone's lives by offering nuts and raisins, a world-renowned deadly combination. next time Ill sprinkle the snacks with finger-sized scorpions just to make it more exciting!"""
4095,"OMG Alex acted happy, she's done for!",Lol people already starting with the HoHitis shit.,"""Wow, Alex managed to smile today? Better pack her bags for Guantanamo Bay!""

""Amazing news! Breaking protocols of basic human emotions might just lead us to uncover a secret government-run Hogwarts for haters."""
4096,(Mercy main btw) Xd,Are you able to find any decent pictures of the actual skin? I'm very interested (Mercy main here).,"1. ""Oh, wow! You mean other than the numerous memes and lore pages already out there? Let me rush and share my encyclopedic knowledge on Mercy's skins. After all, it's not like I have a life or anything."" 
2. ""Well, I'm flattered that you think I'm some kind of a personal photo album, but maybe shoot an email to Blizzard? They might have what you're looking for."""
4097,You guys sound like you have some *greeaaat* parents there,My parents said get over it :(,"1. ""Oh, you're struggling with their wisdom? Let me hold your cape while you fight the good fight against those paAAnts of yours.""

4098,Penso manchi un,Anche gli immigrati se per questo,"1. ""Wow, thanks for enlightening us with your keen observation that immigrants also poop. We were all completely clueless.""

4101,Good riddance eh,Probably because he doesn't play like he's that tall.,"1. What a shame that his height didn't come with extraordinary skills. We'll truly miss that.
2. Be careful what you wish for, next time he might grow taller AND become a better player."
4102,I'm sure the fights were fair and not fixed in anyway,Chechens cheer leader Kadyrov's fighting young sons,"1. Oh, of course, the fights were completely fair! After all, it's not like the Chechen kingpin had anything to gain from staging a little ""family friendly"" competition.
2. Who needs rigged fights when you have a powerful father to guarantee the outcome, right? It's all about family bonding and the spirit of sportsmanship."
4103,His forehead is a moving billboard ffa,He is though,"1. Oh, look at that swaying billboard, seemingly advertising a sale on thick-skin and self-confidence. Guy must be a real steal.
2. I mean, with that much space on his forehead, he must be the smartest person alive. Definitely got a future in chalkboard modelling."
4104,"You wouldn't put a fat person in prison for making her child fat, it would be fat hate",Why are her parents not in prison?,"Oh, that's a tough one! Because if we put parents in prison for every bad decision they make, we'll need to build a whole new prison system just for negligent moms and dads."
4105,Yeah auto posts on twitter have nothing to do with public relations.,"I don't think the Patriot's one counts as a PR move, just a bot someone created without too much foresight.","1. Oh, so ALL those easily programmable auto posts have no impact on public relations? It's not like they help create an intentional image or anything.

4107,But wouldn't that be relevant if you were applying for another supermarket assistant (SA) role?,I'd agree - a continuous job history is beneficial. But I wouldn't expand on quite what I did as a 'supermarket assistant' when I'm applying for a SA role.,"Oh, absolutely! Why would you ever want to embellish your job history or acknowledge any growth in your career goals? Might as well pretend you've been doing the exact same thing for the past 20 years. Talk about ambition, right?"
4108,Well I'm gonna use 100 on a single boss,They haven't said anything beyond we haven't figured out how to use them properly (as I recall).,"Oh great, I finally have enough money to buy a 100-damage takeout order for a single boss. Thanks, science! 

Or, Well, I'm sure the boss will be impressed seeing me spend a whole paycheck on a single hit ‚Äì because they clearly can't fight without my help."
4109,That'll show em!,"I'm done with you, little troll. Shoo! Shoot! Back to your bridge, you have riddles to pose!","Well, I'm positively overcome with sadness that you've sent me back to my bridge.

The king of fourth-quarter comebacks can't pull it off against my second-grade math skills. I'm shaking in my boots. Let the losing continue!"
4112,yeah just the disabled ones,"""Police shouldn't shoot so many black people."" Whoa there, let's not be so extreme.","Oh, absolutely. We should definitely single out and target only the black people with no disabilities. That's a much better approach. Wait, no, the other way around. *rolls eyes* 

Just kidding. of course, the police should be allowed to shoot literally everyone they want, including puppies and baby unicorns. Totally reasonable logic."
4113,"Thanks for Correcting the Record, shill.","I know, and it's not marketing hype. It really does deliver. When you can brown something, then slow cook it in the same pan, then do the rice in it as well, it's pretty convenient. I'm not normally such a shill for products but this thing is pretty great.","First line: ""Oh, it's a miracle! You've completely converted me from a mere shill to a full-blown cult leader. Keep coming up with groundbreaking adjectives like 'pretty great,' we wouldn't want anyone to miss out on this life-changing experience.""

Second line: ""Your eloquence and the enthusiasm in your praises are truly an inspiration. I've been known to critique every single product, but not today. Not for this glorious invention that leaves me speechless. You sir, have bested me."""

That'll teach you to have fun!"
4121,"At least the US has a great, well respected leader in place to handle the situation.",Russia Threatens to Shoot Down U.S. Aircraft in Syria,"Oh, thank God! I was starting to worry that we had an idiot in charge or something. Phew!"

It must be the rainbows, unicorns, and dreamy neighbors that are clearly draining all of our energy and productivity. I mean, how could we possibly manage a task when so much else is going on?"

4198,Give Brother Trump a break!,"Apologists for Trump Some audio recordings have surfaced recently that allegedly show Mr. Trump engaging in lewd and disrespectful conversations towards women. These tapes have been released by Anti-Trump activists in an effort to discredit his candidacy and leadership. These critics have gone as far as to demand that Trump resign his candidacy. As is expected, these critics have failed to evaluate all the available information, and have chosen a very narrow interpretation of the facts we have available to us, opting instead for media-friendly soundbytes that demonize Mr. Trump. The basis for these claims is a single low-quality recording of Mr. Trump engaging in a conversation with another man. A layperson listening to this tape will conclude that the speaker is Donald Trump, but voice analysis and identification is a complex field, and it's easy to jump onto the media bandwagon without proper analysis. Voice identification is more ""art"" than science, and many states don't even allow voice identification to be entered into evidence. Even with leading voice identification techniques, we can only be 99.9% sure that the voice on the recording is Donald Trump's voice. While this is touted by critics as a smoking gun, what they fail to mention is that even with these odds, there are tens of thousands of *other* people whose voice matches the recording. How can we be certain that the voice we've heard is in fact Mr. Trump's? There are over 100 million citizens that have pledged their support for Mr. Trump. If Mr. Trump was really a horrible mysogynist as he's painted to be, how could so many people be misled? And with so many Trump supporters, couldn't we reasonably expect that there would be more than just a single low-quality recording as evidence for his behavior? With all the people he comes in contact with, you would expect more evidence against him. When it comes to Anti-Trump supporters, you will find that they make wild claims against him, but almost always fall short when it comes to producing evidence. Even with taking the recording at face value, it requires a number of significant logical leaps to conclude that Donald Trump was saying the types of things he's being accused of. Most of the recording is actually very benign in nature, and even sentimental as he talks about taking his wife furniture shopping. For example, Donald talks about taking a woman named ""Nancy"" to go furniture shopping. It's automatically assumed that he's referring to someone besides his wife, Melania. However, in American slang, men often refer to beautiful women as ""nancy"", so it would be natural for a man to refer to his wife as nancy. Plus, wouldn't you naturally go furniture shopping with someone you share a home with? It's a big stretch to assume that Donald would engage in an illicit affair by participating in such a domestic activity. Donald's critics have really outdone themselves on this one. What's next? Donald is trying to convince a woman to have sex by purchasing her some cleaning supplies at Walmart? Next, Donald is accused of embracing rape culture by using his social status to kiss and grope women. This claim is so ridiculous on its own that is hardly merits a rebuttal, but we live in a world where even the most ludicrous of claims can spread if they are unchallenged. If Donald Trump really behaved in this way, we would expect to see hundreds of videos of Mr. Trump forcing himself onto women, attempting to kiss them or to grab their genitals. To date, we don't have a single video of this type of behavior, or even a reliable report of such behavior. The lack of evidence speaks volumes. The most inflammatory part of the recording was Donald's use of the term ""pussy"". As we're aware, one of the meanings of this word in American slang is very vulgar and refers to women's genitalia. However, critics fail to explore other common meanings that actually make more sense. The second most well-known meaning is short for ""pussycat"", a common name for a cat. At the time of the alleged recordings, a very famous singing group named The Pussycat Dolls enjoyed widespread success. During this time period, the use of the word ""pussy"" increased dramatically. It's easy for us recoil at hearing this word today, and failing to realize that this was a very common word used in 2005. Also, ""grab the cat by the tail"" is probably one of the oldest and most widely used expressions in the English language. Further, cats have a reputation for short attention span, so the phrase ""grab them by the pussy"" would be a short way of Mr. Trump saying that he was always trying to grab and keep the attention of females during their courtships. It's amazing how these types of accusations can be ... oh... wait... really?? ok... Donald Trump has just confirmed that it was his voice on the tapes, and issued an apology for the language he used. It's not uncommon for us to want our leaders to be perfect, but reading through history and the scriptures, we learn that even the most powerful leader has momentary lapses in judgement. For example, Lot had sex with his daughters, and Noah got drunk and laid out without any clothes on. However, when we understand that our leaders are human, it can add richness and depth to their character, and help us to appreciate them on a deeper, more nuanced level. The message is true, and it's imperative that you donate to the campaign and push this election forward.","Oh, give Brother Trump a break!

Because you claim to be a ""real progressive,"" it's only right that the entire world should bend to your will and focus solely on your pet cause.

4386,Did you enjoy the 4 ferris wheels?,Florida State Fair in Tampa last February. The whole fair was amazing. There were so many rides that I didn't even get on all the ones I wanted!,"Oh, I'm sure it must have been an earth-shattering experience, discovering four Ferris wheels.

It's perfectly reasonable for an outsider to walk into San Francisco's Fleet Week and think they've stumbled upon some obscure, foreign cultural phenomenon. You know, like when I discovered that Americans use ketchup on hot dogs. It's actually really inconspicuous.

2. I love how locals here are so quick to dismiss any outsider's observation of their beloved city. I mean, if I go to Mexico and say ""Hey, they sure do love their tacos down here,"" somebody will immediately call me a taco imperialist or whatever.

Please change it ----------------------------------- Groups should reward 3% bonus xp per player (not counting yourself). A full team of 6 people will give 15% bonus. This will take care of people abusing since 3% isn't much and 20% is too much Then competitive should have a passive 25% xp bonus (value can change). This will encourage more people to comp. Maybe even add a ""first competitive game of the day"" bonus like first win And last, brawls should reward same amount of xp as quick play","Oh wow, such a brilliant idea! Why didn't we think of this before? Let's completely upend the balance of the game to cater to those who can't seem to figure out how to make friends, while ignoring the fact that plenty of players actually enjoy grouping up with their buds.

There is so many parallel though, and that cloak.","Oh, absolutely! Because we all know that glamours and half-hands are commonplace and easily pulled off in everyday life. The fact that they have anything in common at all completely invalidates all logic and reasoning.

No rational seasoned legal expert would say there needs to be constitutional change to amend the Canada health act.

4543,Fixing the fact you play on a console,12gb is huge for a bugfix.,"You're right, because after all, fixing games is only important on a console, not on a PC where you clearly couldn't possibly play. And yea, 12gb is just revolutionary for a game update, especially since everything else takes 5gb."
4544,Once you start encouraging people to use public transit then all of a sudden people want funding for public transit and we can't have that.,"Reminds me. I asked my employer if there were any transit related incentives offered by our company, office complex, or area, and he simply stated: 'No, we aren't that progressive'. I work in the Perimeter area. You'd think they would be equally aggressive in reducing traffic via transit incentives, but nope. Nothing.","Oh, wow! Such kindness and generosity from your employer who cares so much about the environment, right? I mean, who needs public transit when you can all just carpool in a single-passenger car!"
4545,did anyone really doubt the word of Eddie?,"Looks like Hearn is right, Klitschko only cares about the WBA belt.","Response 1:
 ""Well, of course Eddie's word was beyond question - after all, it's not like he's been known to exaggerate or lie once in his life!""

 Response 2:

Provide a solid argument and maybe my opinion of it will change.,"Oh, absolutely. It's not like in this realm of balance, the 7.5 foot tall superhero regularly punches babies or anything. And you know, silence really is equivalent to a nerf, it just never gets used. Such profound insight."
4554,The NX is also a toaster.,"""Wouldn't it be cool"" ideas. What far fetched ideas and wishes have you had about the NX? Mine is it having backwards compatibility with 3ds games. It would be a good tradeoff imo to lose 3d to have a higher resolution. The first games I'd probably play would be Ocarina of Time and Majoras Mask 3D. And before anybody else says it, wouldn't it be cool of the NX were revealed this week?","Oh, absolutely. Imagine if the NX came with a personal chef who cooked your favorite video game-inspired meals while you played. Or how about a built-in solar panel to power your console with endless clean energy? And let's not forget the motion-sensing technology that could read your mind and auto-save your progress. Truly, the sky's the limit when we're talking about the NX!"

4564,They are quick to fix bugs though like miner speed and inferno drag bugs,"Supercell ""balance changes"" ? More like ""card removal"" update. Poison had a unique role of slowing down enemies within the radius to compensate its damage being DoT. Now its fireball-similar damage is DoT with no other benefits. DoT damage should have either higher total damage, or other benefits (such as slow or stun). The slightly larger radius is not so strong when compared to arrow. Expect to see 0 poison usage in SMC top decks with fireball/lightning/rocket/graveyard as replacements. EC's 6 elixir cost would have been fine if hp is also balanced. Now this card will most likely face the same fate. Experience shows Supercell overdoes nerfs as evident in : mortar, x-bow, RG, and GS","Response: Oh, absolutely, Supercell. Your brilliant ""balance changes"" have really shown that you understand the complex nature of aphantasia and how it affects gameplay.

4573,A wizard did it.,"New Porc City In the most recent campaign, Justin played a Porc Sherif from New Porc City. One of the more notable characteristics of Jax Blartowitz was that he was more refined, and less dopey than we are used to from porcs. He wore real clothing, spoke clearly and coherently, and had numerous moments of logical thought and problem solving. So what I've been thinking is that New Porc City is a city that is run by another, more intelligent race such as Elves or Gnomes. The purpose of this city? To adapt and urbanize the Porcs to how the other races live. It teaches them skills and trades that they can apply to jobs in other city/towns (such as being a Sherif) and teaches them how to socialize with others the way other races do (Jax referred to his girlfriend/wife numerous time throughout the campaign). I'd be very interested in seeing a New Porc City campaign in an upcoming season, whether Rob applies this concept to it or not is up to him, but that's my current theory on what it may be.","Oh, absolutely! I mean, this New Porc City must be run by some ridiculously intelligent beings, like elves or gnomes, because let's face it, porcs aren't all that smart. Right, because those porcs are surely incapable of learning new skills, socializing, and adapting to urban life without the guiding hand of some other race. Can you imagine how boring life would be without this genius wizard's intervention?"

I guess the UFC must have finally replaced that mysterious planet they were looking for to host their next event."
4575,How dare you assume their fitness level,"Generally a bad idea, they take risks because they have stylists on set of movies like skyfall. They also have vast amounts of wealth, celebrities that are well dressed tend to be more fit and more attractive than the average person. Basically if you want to copy a Ryan gosling fit don't you don't look like him. You're probably closer to Jonah hill if you see a fit he looks good in maybe copy that","Oh, please! Let's not forget that celebrities also have access to personal trainers, chefs, and a team of stylists who make them look like gods amongst mere mortals. And let's not overlook their luxurious lifestyle that somehow burns calories just by watching them. So, yes, assuming someone's fitness level based on their looks is just like comparing apples to... well, Jonah Hill workin' it."

It's extremely 'in vogue' right now to buy a guitar that has been 'relic-ed' at the factory/off the shelf as we call it. The idea being is that the early production Fender and Gibson models are the ones associated with 'the good old days' of rock and roll and are in some cases considered tonally superior - so they command a massive premium to purchase owing to supply and demand... So, manufactures are creating this worn in/vintage effect as options with their new models. It's a bit like a pair of torn jeans - but we're talking about 5-6k for a brand new hand reliced American Strat or over 35k for a genuine 50s Strat. Often more.

Hi-Rez is a company like all others, since they don't charge you for the game, they need to make money through cosmetic items, when many other companies charge you for both.","You're right, we should all just thank Hi-Rez for sucking slightly less than the other game devs at being greedy.

4839,Yeah fuck you and your sound logic!,"Here's an example: the current minimum wage in Colorado is set by the constitution and is tied to inflation. Unfortunately, that means it will go down in a recession, and almost everybody thinks that's a really bad thing. But, it's not easy to fix: our elected representatives are nearly powerless to do anything. (Incidentally, that's one thing the proposed amendment attempts to fix.). The best they can do is propose an amendment for the citizens to vote on. At best that means it could be fixed once per year, but voter turnout means waiting for a major election. Had the minimum wage been done as a statute, the legislature would have the authority to make these modifications. As would the citizens, via a similar process as constitutional amendments. And if 71 passes, that's even more important.","Oh, absolutely, the minimum wage in Colorado is a perfect representation of sound logic and efficient governance!

I am super hyped about the so-called micro-holidays that they'll be introducing to the game with patch 7.1.5. In a nutshell, a micro-holiday will be ""a holiday, but smaller"". For example, for a single day once a year, there might be an event you can choose to take part in simply because it's immersive. There won't necessarily be any rewards for doing so (but sometimes there will be), and it's purpose is just to keep the world dynamic and immersive throughout the year. *Examples revealed at BlizzCon include:* **Ahn'Qiraj Remembrance Day** **Volunteer Guard Day** **Hatching of the Hippogryphs** **Boat Day** But given that there is so much potential to this feature, and so much world history and knowledge to consider when coming up with events, I thought we could give Blizzard a little help. *Here's my suggestion!* **Day of the First Snow** The arrival of Winter's Veil could be preluded by a single day where it snows across much of Azeroth. It is meant to symbolize Great-father Winter walking across the land, bringing the winter in his tracks.","Oh, fantastic! Gather around, everyone, because Blizzard has created another groundbreaking micro-holiday: ""A day of overpriced deals you'll regret tomorrow"" they're calling it.

5212,"Just you wait until they release the ""Your Combos trigger twice""-minion, it'll make this card so much better!","No Reddit, Gadgetzan Ferryman is not in the same league as Purify (I read a comment yesterday on how you get mercilessly downvoted for going against popular wisdom on leaked cards, so here I am trying it myself.) To the matter at hand. Is Gadgetzan Ferryman as bad as Purify, or anywhere close? No. To start, a large part of why Purify was so bad was the context. Priest went into Kara with a new thread every day bemoaning how trash it was, in both arena and constructed. Blizzard had 3 cards to address this, and used one of them for one of the worst cards in the game. Is Purify really that bad? Yes. Blizzard took what was already a pretty terrible card (Silence), nerfed it, and then gave it the most expensive card draw mechanic in the game. Usually card draw adds 1-1.5 cost to a card. Here it adds 2+. Which is not to say that Purify isn't occasionally fun to play with, or even that with the right supporting cards, it might not actually make it into a competitive deck. So let's compare that with Gadgetzan Ferryman. First off, Rogue is not in nearly as bad a space as Priest was. It's still #2 in Arena, and pretty much everyone at Blizzcon brought 1 Miracle Rogue. It does have a lack of viable deck archetypes right now, and I know we all would like to see some healing, but it's much more robust than Priest was. Furthermore, Rogue is getting 12 cards this expansion, not to mention the neutrals, so the pressure on any given card to turn things around is much less. But on to the card, finally. It is obviously comparable to Youthful Brewmaster, which isn't really played anyway. In this comparison it looks a little worse because of the combo requirement, but I think that might be a wash at this point for Rogue. It means you can play this to build board presence without having to bring something back, which is sometimes what you need. I have no idea if the 2/3 statline is better than 3/2. For me though, ""Bounce"" Rogue is one of my favourite decks to play, and I might sub this in for Ancient Brewmaster, because cheaper bounces are better. Finally, in arena I think this is better than Youthful Brewmaster. Bounces can actually be really great later on in arena, but having a brewmaster stuck in your hand as you try to build board is terrible. The Ferryman avoids that, while making the bounce available later if you need it.","Oh well, maybe if you ask nice enough, Blizzard will make Purify better so it can be as good as Gadgetzan Ferryman. I hear wishful thinking is contagious these days."
5213,You forgot the,"Salmon and Nicola Sturgeon have to be some of my favorite politicians.

5401,BUT TRUMP IS A RACISTS MYSONGIST DOUCHBAG.,I wanted to be an archeologist when I was in Kindergarten... Indiana Jones was an inspiration.

5422,How dare voters judge me by my actions!,Brazile: Democrats' emails were 'weaponized' against them,"Oh, of course! Because it's so common for people to make political decisions based on comedic performances. I guess that explains the success of politicians like Dane Cook and Jim Belushi."
5423,STFU U LIBTARD,"What do people 'naturally' feel, pray tell? Asides from the need to eat, shit and breathe? Nearly everything is a social construct that's been taught.

5439,"Obviously if someone is hurt you cannot touch them at all to stop them from dying, it's illegal you know","It's only illegal if you present yourself as doctor.

5506,She definitely deserves $15/hr,"I work for a fast food restaurant. I've been there for five months and work five days a week. I've seen plenty of people come and go, but 'Jay' is the absolute worst. She is incredibly unprofessional at very inappropriate times. For example, telling people that they should be nice to us because we can spit in their food and that we will..? More often than not, I'm working at one of the drive thru windows. I take cash, while Jay takes orders over the headset. I've heard her say multiple expletives over the speaker and very rudely tell people that she can't understand their accents (she literally said this to someone with a Boston accent, we're not from the East coast, but seriously?). Of course, no matter the accent, she sends them to me at the first window and tells me to speak to them in 'their language.' I made the mistake of telling her I speak Spanish and a very small amount of Norwegian and Italian, which I guess to her means I speak every language. Unless they speak Spanish, I of course speak with them in English and get everything sorted out, all the while apologizing profusely on behalf of her. This has happened many times and after nearly every single one she says the exact same thing - she's amazed I can even understand them and that 'they should really learn better English.' Earlier this week she even told me, ""Your English is amazing for a 'spic."" I am half Spanish and half Russian, it didn't really bother me, but god she really has no common sense, she doesn't know how to think before she speaks. If she had said that to another one of the Latina ladies she would have been fucked. Not only is she racist, she shows up ten minutes late every god damned day, then complains about her ankle hurting or feeling like she's going to puke, and of course 'forgets' to clock out when the managers get fed up of her complaining and send her home. I've also watched as she threw hamburger buns at a maintenance man because 'he was in her way.' She's being fired this weekend though!! She got into a fight with some other white trash girl outside the restaurant, cops were called and I personally enjoyed watching their little scuffle. The store manager told her they're having a 'talk' with her tomorrow when she comes in. Hallelujah!","First line: ""Oh, absolutely! It's not like she spits in the food on purpose or anything.""

The writers probably pitched this idea and thought it might be funny, which it could be in theory. The fact that this was not included, among probably hundreds of other scenes that didnt fit with the office vibe, is a testament to the Creators and producers who pick and choose not what would be the goofiest character arc but what would be best for the story line. Sacrificing a cheap laugh for the shows continuity is a bold choice but Daniels, I think, 100% made the right one","Oh wow, I had no idea that a few deleted scenes define the entire genius of Greg Daniels and the showrunners.

5543,A REPUBLIC NOT A DEMOCRACY!,ELI5 What are they actually protesting? What is the immediate outcome they are pursuing? Are Democrats protesting democracy? I don't get it.,"Oh, absolutely no need to worry. They're just a bunch of people who wanted to demonstrate their complete misunderstanding of politics while clutching their misplaced values, all while providing some grade-A comedic material for the rest of us. #SecureMyLaughs"

5546,Pretty easy to survive something that never happened,and holocaust survivor,"Oh, please, survive a non-event? That must have been a piece of cake! Sprinkles and rainbows, I imagine."
5547,"Nah, this is clearly intentional because the developers hate their fan base.",It's not just one person working on it and I'm sure sometimes things get forgotten or overlooked.,"Oh, absolutely! Because when a game isn't broken with spaghetti code and duct tape, that must mean the developers are sending us hate mail. Wow, they're really making their disdain known through oversights."
5548,"Because here in NH, we have some of the weakest gun laws and an absurdly high gun violence rate.","Those are near or in right wing/right wing leaning states. Case in point, you can go directly outside of the city and buy a gun. You can't do that in NYC or Los Angeles or San Francisco. The ability to buy a gun is still by far the single biggest factor in crime rate.","Oh, absolutely fascinating! So in New Hampshire, where the people are just so weak that they need a gun on every corner to feel safe, your high crime rate must only be driven by their inability to defend themselves from threats like, I don't know, cute squirrels or something. Brilliant logic!"
5549,Obviously the reason he would always ban it in solo queue was because he didn't want anyone to realize how broken Aatrox really is.,AP Aatrox 100%,"1. Oh, it's such a shocker! Did you really just discover that banning Aatrox in solo queue could be because he's broken? Gasp!

5551,You don't get up and walk away when you get bad rng?,These guys really like to sell the drama don't they?,"Oh, you're one of those people who needs everything to go their way. Next thing you'll be asking for a unicorn to be your personal assistant."
5552,"Exactly, it's all just retribution","It can't be, because racism against white people doesn't exist, right? -_-","Oh, wow! Thanks for enlightening me that racism against white people is as common as finding a needle in a haystack. Glad we got that sorted out. And btw, I perfectly understand why they haven't hired One Direction to reunite and fight against this horrid issue, they must be too busy picking up their non-existent racism awards."
5553,Get out.,This is Utterly amazing news (please excuse me),"Oh, I'm so sorry for intruding on your ""utterly amazing"" moment. Please, continue being blown away while I ""excuse"" myself."

Well, if writing your title like a neon sign in all caps and stuffing it with a million tags wasn't enough to make this video irresistible, then clearly nothing will. Bravo, you've mastered the art of clickbait."

Why didn't someone think of this in the stone age?""

""I don't know how we've survived without your genius genius idea... possibly because it's been possible for centuries?"""
5563,"But it's part of our country's electoral tradition since the invention of the electoral college, we should all just accept their vote as the correct outcome and rally behind one candidate as a unified country, just like we all did with Obama","If it happened, I think everyone is completely forgetting how much outrage it would cause. Do you expect the Trump supporters to just peacefully let that happen?","Ah, the beauty of our electoral system ‚Äì where one candidate's win is a triumph of democracy, and the other's loss is just everyone learning to accept the new reality, together. Truly a model for the world to follow."
5564,"Wait, people play public matches?",The servers are online again :),"Oh wow, who would've thought people still play games in public? I thought it was all solitaire and crossword puzzles out there."
5565,Dont die,Gitting gud?,"1. Oh, of course, because conquering this game is as easy as learning to breathe! I'm surprised death is even a possibility!
2. Wow, suggesting I don't die? What a groundbreaking improvement to my clearly inadequate gaming skills."
5566,Silyisis,Who would you want to be among the first to complete the Easter Egg?,"1. Well, since you asked, I'd want Silyisis to be first, because if they can't master an Easter Egg, how are they supposed to even boil one? 

2. Oh, fabulous news! Silyisis beating everyone to finding the Easter Egg... I wonder if that means we'll have chocolate eggs raining from the sky as a celebration."

5575,Wait ... It wasn't?,"Only 27 games made before 2010, and only 3 made before 2000 make the list. So many amazing games in the last 6 years, it's almost like the hobby was invented in that time.","Oh, what a huge surprise! I had no idea games from ancient times like, let's say 2000 or even 2010, could be considered amazing! I guess we should all just forget about those stone-aged games."
5576,Obviously a God Emperor is the answer.,That excuse has worn out its welcome.,"Oh, so a God Emperor is still the answer? Great, because I was really starting to worry about all the other issues we face on planet Earth."
5577,Solution: be better than everyone else on your team so you're the mvp and no one has to see the dumb victory emotes,"""The Victory Animations will only appear for the MVP and only if they have the Elite uniform equipped.""

5582,how does 199 proof sound?,Purest alcohol you can find and a coffee filter.,"Oh, a coffee filter? Well, that'll definitely separate the alcohol molecules, like a pro. Just wait for the impurities to settle and taste the pure essence of 'Whoa, why did I take a spoonful of 199 proof?!'"
5583,"Nah bro, attack ads not addressing any sort of policy should be enough.","Hillary spent 5-6 times more money than Donald Trump, yet lost nearly all the swing States. May next time stop spending time in high dollar dinner with donors, and instead spend time rallying actual voters","Oh wow, imagine that! All those fancy dinners with donors really totally had no impact on anything. Silly Hillary.

If Derek Provides proof that he is payed, REAL PROOF, I will apologize and delete the post.","Well, if saying 'nice things' is an indicator of getting paid, I've clearly received my million-dollar salary today. Your logical prowess is truly astounding. Keep up the great work!"
5585,"Yep, because everyone that didn't vote hillary is an absolute retard!",Trump voters are too stupid to change their minds anyway,"Oh, absolutely, the bright minds of Trump voters would never be able to figure out they made a mistake. After all, they probably think the sun rises and sets with Orange Julius."
5586,So that therefore means any statement that we can't do something will be proven wrong in ten years,"""... And it'll be at least fifty years until a computer can beat a professional Go player,"" said the conventional wisdom ten years ago.","Well, they sure nailed that prediction. In ten years, we'll have chimpanzees playing Go on quantum computers while piloting Mars colonies. I can't wait! üòò"
5587,Easy solution (if we let Trump take office); we just convince him to mastermind (as much as someone with his mind can do that) a military operation to take over Canada.,"Theoretically, the NSA cannot turn their massive tracking, codebreaking, and analytical machines on anything entirely domestic. Once it crosses a border, it's now under their authority and will be sucked into their repositories, processed, and used for their operations.","Ah, brilliant! Let's just make Trump the mastermind of a Canadian invasion. That'll certainly show the NSA how it's done. Because we all know he's a military genius who can analyze and track anything."

5592,Hahahahahahahahaha,So my brother was setting the table up for Thanksgiving and picked out an odd tablecloth... That's our old shower curtain.,"Wow, the Thanksgiving spirit truly shines through when you can repurpose your aging shower curtain into a festive tablecloth. Thank goodness we have such remarkable interior designers in the family."
5593,You could probably visit where the old TCU campus was.,@BaylorBears I'm headed to Waco- what's good? A few K-State students are coming down to the game this Saturday!

Wherever that is, right? And as for tailgating and eating recommendations, just don't bother with the food, it's not like it'll be anything special. Just kidding, enjoy your stadium that's so beautiful people come to Waco just to see it."
5594,Apparently the Sweden pp is trash....,"The Provies: Stechermania runs wild, along with coaching changes, a Russian mauling and the Eriksson Dilemma","Oh yeah, Sweden's national team is really struggling. They must do terrible every time, considering your extensive expertise on the subject. And who doesn't love some good old Stechermania? It's like Christmas in July for the fans!"
5595,How dare you call undocumented aliens illegal just because they are here illegally.,"What is it that you don't understand about the word illegal? Do you think it's just a word made up by the KKK? It has nothing to do with race, gender, sexuality or whatever. If you are in a country illegally you should be deported, end of story. Now, if you enter the legal way, you are more than welcome to stay. If we keep illegal immigrants in our country, then maybe we should keep every criminal out of prison? Because that's your logic.","Oh, I see! So if they break into a bakery instead of a country, that's totally cool? And if a criminal has a visa, they can keep committing crimes? Wow, your rhyming logic is truly a game-changer."
5596,Sounds like he really lost there.,"I dumped a guy for trying to celebrate that shit near me. I own a pussy, the LAST thing im gonna do is give it to someone who votes for an asshole who thinks grabbing random women by their crotch is his right","1.

5605,"Yeah, because Kyrie breaks 3+ ankles per game.","At the beginning of the year, you could break ankles easily. Now I break ankles like once every five games which isn't realistic","Oh, poor baby! You used to break ankles six times a game and now it's down to once every five?

2. Wow, Freud must be rolling over in his grave, such groundbreaking analysis."
5611,You mean liberal elite ivy league corporate owned expert economists from some north eastern university?,"Everyone seems to be forgetting that all of these 'solutions' Trump has proposed amount to nothing more than one sentence white-board-ideas that have no basis in reality. It cracks me up that people seem to think the world's leading economists have never had the thought, 'let's just implement tariffs and make imports so expensive companies are motivated to make them here'. Forgetting that there would be enormous consequences beginning with tariffs being immediately slapped on our exports making them far less appealing to the world market. If you enjoy $200 42 in HD TVs and under $100 Kindles etc... kiss those goodbyes. Not only that, assuming that we could bring back every lost manufacturing job somehow, it would take a decade for the US to build the infrastructure and manufacturing facilities necessary to even begin to match China and the rest of the world's manufacturing power combined. If we pull those levers it's not like countries not named China aren't going to step in and immediately fill their place. We live in a globalized economy. Even it were the prudent and intelligent thing to do there is no way to undo it at this point that would not result in enormous short and intermediate term pain for the economy and country. There is **plenty** of wealth being generated, that is not the problem, the problem is in how it's distributed. Everything Trump wants to do in that space would simply compound the problems.","Oh, absolutely, let's listen to those ivory tower expert economists from the swanky east coast universities.

5612,"yeah, i think the artstyle of the game also really drives this point home","It's a critical view of ""progress"". We all are quite familiar to the hegemonic world view that is given to us, in schools, television, movies and such, so I think it's quite nice to have a different view in this game. If anything, it is to show that progress has a price, paid in blood, sweat, tears and depression sometimes.","""Oh, absolutely! The mind-blowing art style in this game just shoves that critical viewpoint down our throats. It's not like we've ever seen thought-provoking art before in our sheltered lives."" 

""Yeah, because nothing says 'progress comes with a cost' like a glossary of complex art terms and drawing tears from depression. Next you'll tell me that ice is cold!"""
5613,"No, using an 84 rated is cheating and you should stop.",I have IF Manolas and have used smalling. I can tell you Manolas is definitely better. I feel Boateng and IF Manolas are the best defenders in the game. Also Sergio Ramos and then Smalling maybe imo. And that's not counting legends ofc.,"Oh, absolutely. The game is all about utilizing 84-rated players to gain an unfair advantage. How could we ever expect to become World Champions without lagging and swapping players every three seconds?"
5614,"No, he's literally Hitler",Isn't Trump the nazi? That's what cnn told me anyway,"1. Oh, so you're an expert on Nazi theory, just like how the Apocalypse was reported on by CNN Weather.

5618,And uncertainty always does wonders for the economy.,i like being left in suspense,"Oh, absolutely! Uncertainty is like the secret ingredient in the economy's delicious soup of anxiety. It's what gives it that certain je ne sais quoi! You really know how to live on the edge there, my friend."

5621,What if this is really about Cespedes and the Jay Bruce thing is just a fake out?,REPORT: Blue Jays and Mets have discussed a trade,"Oh, perfect. Because it's totally believable that a team would trade away one rumored target just to distract us from another. Hockey players pulling off this level of deception? Now, that's really something."

The ranking system that made those games good was removed, and the multiplayer was completely broken and unplayable for months. It was a bunch of old games minus everything that we liked about them and that's it. This is a brand new game, and a full remaster of another game that was widely regarded as the best in the series. With so much backlash against a game that turned out to be pretty damn good, I don't blame them at all for making people give it a chance.

The problem is that it may be hard to get a *conviction*, since I don't expect Dubai's authorities will be very forthcoming with witness statements, no rape kit was likely conducted, and so on.

5726,I love how the borgies have it all figured out!,"It's cute how idealistic you are, you have a lot to learn about the world. Fact is, there is no perfect system. A few things though... 1- What does person A's dad having cancer have to do with anything? Person B's dad is just as likely to have cancer too. 2- Garbage collectors are actually paid a decent wage. 3- Garbage collectors aren't garbage collectors because of some sort of altruistic desire, they just aren't qualified enough for something else. 4- Being wealthy and getting an education isn't a bad thing, nor is running a business and making money. 5- There is nothing wrong with buying stocks and selling them to someone who is willing to pay more for it later. 6- People don't buy houses and leave them empty until they appreciate so they can make money off it when they sell it, if anything they buy a house and rent it out to people who cannot afford to purchase it themselves. 7- People aren't homeless because rich people buy multiple houses. 8- No businessman is going to ensure people can afford less stuff, they would want to have people afford more stuff because they would be buying more of the stuff he sells, thus making more money. 9- People affording less stuff isn't a bad thing, that would be the opposite of consumerism, which is actually a root cause of capitalism. Create/build something that people want and then sell it to them. 10- The free market for products spurs competition, innovation and actually can regulates prices. A true free market can't really exist though because people are greedy, so we have a regulated free market to prevent collusion and monopolizing of limited or essential resources. 11- I fail to see any connection that makes a free market and protecting workers any kind of opposites. Some things you missed... What about person C? The person who grew up poor, got scholarships to go to college and because a successful business owner? What about person D who was rich, handed everything in life, went to college but learned nothing, was given a company and had no idea what to do and ended up broke and living on the streets when his family ran out of money? Why do you think there are only 2 types of people possible? What is really needed is a blend of every possible system, taking some pieces of each and fitting them together to make a world that works as well as possible. There will always be a disparity between the rich and the poor, and both of those will always exist relative to one another. If we truly had a world where everyone is equal and everyone received an equal share regardless of what they contribute, what motivation would anyone have to put in any kind of extra effort? Why would anyone want to collect trash? Why would anyone want to clean septic tanks or shovel manure? Why would anyone invent something new if there was nothing to gain from it? Who would do all the shitty, dangerous, gross jobs if there was no need to do them because they would still get an equal share even by doing nothing? We don't live in a pure capitalistic society, we live in a world that is capitalistic, but there's quite a bit of socialism thrown in everywhere. Also, your very post is ignoring one thing that is most important, and makes a massive assumption that actually favors capitalism over anything else. You assume that the poor person is unhappy because they are poor, and you assume the wealthy person is happy. You are equating wealth with happiness, thus endorsing a society where someone needs to earn money to become rich somehow to be happy. That's just false, not all rich people are happy and not all poor people are unhappy.","Oh wow, I'm just floored by your deep understanding of the world. It's fantastic that you've figured it all out and have the perfect system planned out, right down to the minor details like garbage collectors and how many types of people exist. Your blend of all possible systems seems like a real breeze to implement. And let's not forget, wealth equals happiness, and for those who aren't happy with just tons of money, they must just be bad at being rich. Keep spreading that wisdom, champ. The world needs more people like you telling everyone else how it's done."

5785,"Ok, a troll reply, enjoy your amazing superiority","No I'm just laughing at your copy paste idea, one you haven't a clue why but it's clear you've seen someone else suggest it and are going with that. You're nerfing the forward thinking and patient people while buffing the lazy, all so people that don't want to change attributes don't have to and don't feel bad about training while not optimised.

Obama's good at getting people to vote for him, but his policies are out of touch with the direction many American's feel they need to go. I think this is evident with the performance of the Democratic Party since he was elected to office.

Democrats have lost 15 state legislatures since Obama's first term and at least 11 governorships.

I play Elite Dangerous on my XBOX One and I love it even if I don't play it all the time, it's one of those games that you can pick up anytime for a, albeit somewhat, small session or waste all your free time on it. I would love to be flying my ship on the big screen on the online mode and then take the tablet and go somewhere playing offline, which is thankfully the same exact experience without other people.","Oh great, another game suggestion!

I know I'm super late to the party here, and I keep seeing these stations come upon comments, but I haven't caught a post mentioning them together. Sooo... We have some really solid public radio in North Texas, and over the last year or so it's become just about all I listen to. None of them are direct replacements for KDGE, but I had personally been more and more disappointed in what was being played anyway. 91.7 KXT is an outstanding music station that plays long sets with little interruption and huge variety. One of their big bragging rights is that they play, at minimum, one local band every hour. They play from a wide range of styles, but you mostly hear a variety of rock and indie music. You may tune in to something that's not your thing, but more often than not when it happens to me it's something I haven't really heard before. At that rate I'd rather listen to something I don't like so much and then be aware of something new than hear a song I don't love or hate for the thousandth time. 89.3 KNON is a long running public station that's mostly music, but does run in an old school ""program"" format. So you may tune in to something that just isn't you at one time slot, but if you check in at different times, even different days, you'll start noticing the programs that you do and don't like. They do a blues show in the early evenings that's solid and ranges from scratchy old recordings from way back to current blues acts from around the country, usually really good stuff. Also, every Thursday from 8 PM - 12 AM Hard Time Radio is on, which is real heavy metal and hard rock, like REAL heavy, it's one of my favorite things on the radio right now, if for no other reason than it's different from anything else on the air. They are in the middle of a pledge drive right now, so especially if you're into metal or rock, it's a great time to check it out and think about supporting something unique. 90.1 KERA is the well known public talk radio for NTX and is an affiliate of NPR/PBS. It is basically all talk. If you enjoy talk radio shows, but find the snarky conversations and commentary on a lot of the commuter slot shows to be a little much, it's definitely worth checking out. I have always found the shows to have a good blend of information and entertainment, and most of the time they do a good job of including a wide variety of opinions represented by guests if not hosts. If nothing else, the beauty of public radio is that it's mostly listener supported, and while you certainly catch the occasional pledge drive, you'll hear virtually no commercials through most of the year. 102.1 as we know it ultimately went of the air because the corporation that owns it sees a better opportunity to profit from the channel and that's the business they're in. Most of the comments I've read have been to the effect that people are sorry to see it go, but haven't really enjoyed it all that much for the last few years anyway, and that's exactly how I feel. With public broadcast, support dictates programming, so if there's something you're glad is on the air, you can personally have a hand in keeping it there. TLDR; listen to public radio. 91.7, 89.3, and 90.1 are all awesome in different ways.","Oh wow, how stunning! Public radio is single-handedly saving our souls from the dumpster fire that is mainstream radio. Give it a gold star, give it a giant tax-exempt budget, let it play air guitar non-stop to the rockin' tunes of public support!"
5850,Conor is charismatic and more likable than a stoic russian therefore it's okay if he acts like a dick,Conor drops 22 F-bombs and insults the whole goddamn roster in a post fight interview and you aren't happy with Khabib? Just saying.,"Oh, absolutely. It's not like you have any right to feel insulted when Khabib stays silent like a stone-faced monk, right? And I bet we'd all be over the moon if Conor said 44 F-bombs instead of just 22. Critics, amirite?"
5851,I hope you dropped this,"What do you mean the dems aren't socialist, the CPUSA endorsed Clinton","Your comedic timing is impeccable, just like that devastating drought in Alaska. For real, who knows when sarcasm will strike next?"

5853,The hypochondria is the power house of the cell Wait no that's not right.,"Not necessarily in the chest, but every time I have some harmless little pain I convince myself I am going to die an horrible, long and agonising death and spent the next hours (or days) basically unable to function for the fear. Yeah, anxiety and hypochondria aren't a fun mix.","Oh, absolutely. Your hypochondria is like a tiny soldier singlehandedly keeping the cell's power house running. And don't even get me started on anxiety ‚Äì it's like having a personal butler dedicated to making sure you're always on the brink of a nervous breakdown."
5854,"Uh huh, suuuuuuuuuuuure.","Sadly this is true. Personally? I'd definitely worry about the ""good looking"" guy's intentions but appreciate the lovely normal guy. Then ask him out for lunch. He'd have a lot more interesting things to talk about than Mr Fancy Pants.","Oh great, another paragon of sarcasm chiming in. You must be a real barrel of laughs at parties, always delivering deep wisdom like ""uh huh, suuuuuuuuuuuure."" Honestly, if there's a Nobel Prize for dashing the hopes of romantics, you'd be its poster child."
5855,shhh... its sexism.. she actually is only being called about for corruption because shes a female....,Let's not get confused. Hillary may be an order of magnitude better than Trump as a presidential candidate but her scandals showed her to be corrupt and dangerously hawkish.,"Oh, please, don't let the facts get in the way of your conspiracy theory. I mean, it's not like her scandals were the result of her own actions or anything."
5856,"So black people do age, if they have a job.",Had no idea he has retractable ears.,"Oh wow, I was absolutely under the impression that black people somehow defied the law of time and aging when they have a job.

5857,The logic there is astounding.,"Finally, here we have it... Why shoulders are porn.","Oh wow, truly staggering how viewers couldn't appreciate the art of shoulders prior to this groundbreaking revelation. You should write a book."
5858,I thought it was common knowledge that Bejing is a critical campaign stop on the road to being BC's Primer.,"Federally there is a 1500$ cap on individual contributions, in Quebec the cap is 100$. BC is like the wild west for donations to political parties, we don't even have a restriction on foreign governments donating to BC political parties.","Oh, absolutely! Beijing's influence is just invaluable for every BC political hopeful. After all, you can't buy popularity with just local taxes!"
5859,nah it's the sexists and racists,"As someone who doesn't live in America it seemed to me that she didn't lose to Trump, but defeated herself.","Oh, absolutely, it's ALWAYS the sexists and racists ruining everything for everyone else. Great observation, Sherlock."
5860,But it's SO much work!,"Pretty much all pistols field strip similarly. Pop slide off of frame, remove recoil spring and barrel. Done.","Oh, the noble art of disassembling a pistol has never seemed more taxing. I weep for the future generations who will carry on this backbreaking tradition."
5861,"Yes, because Clinton wouldn't have drilled and definitely wouldn't have taken money from big oil companies","he could have never gotten it past a republican congress. he was probably hoping for clinton to come in with a democrat senate. he could have tried back when he had a dem congress, but he was focused on healthcare","Oh, absolutely! Clinton would have totally prioritized drilling over healthcare. I mean, who cares about people's well-being when there's oil to be drilled, right? *rolls eyes*"
5862,"Canberra now has the Capital Coast Mariners, no need for a new team",Canberra aren't putting in any bids atm. They won't happen if no one puts any renewed effort.,"Oh, congratulations!

5863,It's okay though because the internet said vegans are annoying.,TIL most redditors don't know even the most basic facts regarding cruelty in animal agriculture.,"1. ""Oh, absolutely nothing can beat the wisdom of the internet, I must admit. After all, whenever I want to learn something new, '‡•§TIL' is my go-to source.""

5864,Well then he's just doing her a favour,3. If she's a fatty,"Oh, absolutely! Because we all know a favor is defined as, ""Giving assistance to someone who really, really needed it."" 

The helpful spirit truly knows no bounds these days. Just let that fat kid play!"
5865,Hey the kneepads are for the kids who get forced to suck dick in churches,Amazon did it right with this new commercial.,"Oh, absolutely, watching that Amazon commercial changed my faith forever. It's like finally seeing proof of a higher power... or just really good marketing."
5866,People have gfs on this sub?,Aah..the joy of having a gf. At least your gf plays pokemon.,Isn't it amazing how some people manage to find love while the rest of us are stuck in a never-ending quest for a decent internet connection?
5867,Totally not something that would need a hotfix,Well this is something I havent seen before. Shot through a door...,"Oh, great! Another groundbreaking moment in door-shooting technology. This has truly revolutionized my entire door-interaction experience."
5868,Precision shooters,"This saddens me. How can people be such asshats that they would hunt a deer with a .22 magnum, and try for headshots? Damn it...","1. Oh, the humanity! People hunting with a .22 magnum, what'll they think of next? Harboring whales with fire hoses?
2. If only there was some kind of law against using such small-caliber weapons for hunting...probably wouldn't hurt the deer any, right?"
5869,Is this Trump's America?,What the hell did I just witness?,"Oh, right, this is definitely the epitome of Trump's America - where bizarre, inexplicable events happen every day. Welcome to the new norm, folks!"

5871,The free market wins again!,Hit the internet with anti-net neutrality laws and kill the competition...,"Well, color me shocked that big corporations managed to screw over the little guy once again. It's a beautiful thing, really. Just another day in the land of meritocracy."
5872,Saw I to XVI,Need suggestions for Movies please post movies you think everyone would enjoy. so we can all watch together.,"1. Oh, fantastic! They just don't make movies like Saw 2 anymore. I can't wait to see Leigh Whannell's latest bloodbath!
2. You mean besides all the sequels in every franchise? Great, let's toss a coin to decide between Die Hard 4 and Men in Black III."
5873,Because he ate KFC,"I just don't get how people thought a billionaire who lives at the top of a skyscraper in NYC with his name on it is somehow ""a man of the people"".","1. Oh, so if he downgrades to a bucket of KFC, suddenly he's hanging with the common folk? Alrighty then.
2. Well, I guess we've finally found the secret to connecting with the proles: chicken, fries, and a dose of low self-esteem. Brilliant."
5874,because doing it virtually is the same as the real thing...,When you want to make fun of ed8ers but ed8rs get laid while you dont :(,"1. Oh, absolutely, virtual experiences are identical to the real thing, especially when it comes to scoring a hot date. I've become an expert at doing the glorious ""hand clap"" dance in my room shedding a single bitter tear for your joy.
2. How wonderful! I'm genuinely so happy for you, and the ed8rs, because while we're all stuck swiping away in the virtual world, you guys are out there getting some real-life action and making me feel like the loser I am."
5875,he did hide helm slot before it was cool?,not full cuz he doesn't have the helmet on :p,"Oh wow, he was clearly ahead of his time in hiding his helm slot, just like Tesla with that whole electric car thing."
5876,They substituted Mormons to satisfy the PC crowd.,It's really really good. Book of Mormon was also really good and had just as outrageous prices. Also it makes sense it's basically the wiz to the wizard of oz,"1. Oh wow, such brave and unprecedented move, now everyone can leave their dignity at the door and enjoy great value Mormon-less entertainment! 
2. Yes, thank you for catering to the overly sensitive masses by removing Mormons from it. Such a breath of fresh air, one wonders how we lived without it."
5877,cody zeller and his moving screens,"Best screeners in the NBA? I think Bogut has to be up there, at least top 5. Good passing big man also. I think Klay misses him. Who are some of the best in setting screens? Barnes pretty good one for an SF too.","1) ""Oh, absolutely. Just what we needed‚Äîa moving screen film starring Cody Zeller. It's going to be the next big blockbuster!""

We're just lucky to have your wisdom."""
5879,I prefer Beth Mowins.,I love these announcers,"1. ""Oh, wow, I didn't know preferring Beth Mowins was the key to world peace.""

5880,Well if **you** don't know about it then obviously it (they) don't exist.,"I can only think of one, and that was the whole debacle with the marriage licenses.","Oh, wow! Like it's not hard enough to find something hidden between a rock and a hard place, but then you go and vanish it too? Dude, when did you become the god of invisibility?"
5881,"Not really trying to prove anything, other than you should never trust anyone ever.","Hehe um, what were you trying to prove there?","Oh, so you're just trying to help build trust in humanity there? Thanks for the heads up, Sherlock."
5882,At least he didn't get autism.,Smallpox face.,"1. ""Oh, thanks for the reassurance. I mean, who wouldn't rather have autism over a 'smallpox face'? Those are truly our only options in life.""

2. ""Wow, that's really thoughtful. If I'm ever in a position to choose a terrible affliction, I'll definitely opt for autism over a 'smallpox face.' Such a tough decision."""
5883,Just make sure you pick someone who is playing further up the pitch with good underlying stats.,Joe Allen Replacement Thread,"Oh, absolutely, just pull a top-tier performer out of thin air and hope they magically have great underlying stats too. Quite a simple task, really."
5884,The Catholic Church is literally Sauron,A picture of the moon through the towers of St. Cecelia's Cathedral in Omaha,"""Wow, seeing the moon through the cathedral's towers was so breathtaking. It's definitely not like witnessing an innocent hobbit getting corrupted by that subtle villain, Sauron.""

5885,"No, no, I think it's pronounced Suh-lah-me.","Well, with an Australian accent and sa-leme","""Oh, okay! Because it's clearly not difficult to differentiate between a French cheese and an ice rink. Thanks for clearing that up!"" *snorts*"
5886,RX-0 Unicorn for br 8.0 MT pls,Gaijigglez plz give this to the japanese...,"Oh, absolutely! Let's just stuff a rainbow full of LSD into a What-The-Fork and ship it over to Japan. You know, because they're the experts in unicorn-induced pissed-off unicorn hallucinations."
5887,Are you gender-shaming your gunner ?,"DShK GAZ traverse speed I wasn't expecting much in the way of performance from this thing, but I certainly wasn't expecting the traverse speed to this bad. After all, it's a pintle machine gun on a large flatbed. How could anyone who isn't a frail old man fail to spin it around pretty fast? 21.4 degrees per second is a joke. The vehicle, with its 50 round belt, 10 second reload, and inability to aim backwards even though the gunner could sit or crouch on the ammo box, wouldn't be as terrible as it is if the gunner didn't identify as a snail.","""Oh, such a brave snail fighting the enemy with its impressive 21.4-degree-per-second traverse speed, reframing what it means to be a slow and steady gunner!""

""Knowing that the gunner's speed is akin to an actual snail, we should start calling this gun platform the 'Tortoise of War,' for its unparalleled ability to leave everyone guessing what comes next."""

Paid $2 for a normal $11 item.","""Well, aren't we just living the American Dream? Saving 9 bucks by buying pre-used products. You'd think you're in a thrift store."""
5889,Thanks for clearing that up.,You're wrong.,"1. ""Oh, absolutely, my deepest apologies for bursting your inflated ego. How could I ever think otherwise?""

5891,Everyone knows that everything bad ever was because of Obama.,Do they think that unpaid internships started with Obama's presidency?,"Oh, absolutely! You couldn't possibly have bad coffee or a paper cut from a printout before Obama decided to go rogue on unpaid internships. What a revolutionary president!"

5894,I think somebody started a rumor that Trump bought Disney,"Funny, the dude from Hamilton worked on the music for this.","1. ""Well, that's just fantastic! Now not only did Trump buy Disney, but he also got Lin-Manuel Miranda to write for our new 'Orange Kingdom Parade'. Brilliant!""

2. ""You think? Who would've guessed the guy who made 'Hamilton' would be the perfect choice to compose the theme song for Trump's new amusement park: Trump's National Nightmare World."""
5895,Oh that was a good one.,Your mom wishes she could get scraps.,"1. ""Well, thank you for the validation, I was starting to doubt my comedic genius. Your mom must be laughing her scrappy socks off right now!""

5896,"Never punch to the right, cuck.","No dissent in the new regime, silly!","Oh, absolutely revolutionary! Here's a whole new world where nobody disagrees ‚Äì so unique and groundbreaking. What will they think of next: people not fighting?"
5897,And vodka is water.,piwa is beer. thats all u need to know,"Wow, who knew the universe's complexity could be summarized in three words: piwa is beer. What a revelation! I'm off to write my Nobel Prize-winning theorem."
5898,CTF,"Best game mode for EXP? If you're 4th prestige+, can you tell me what game mode is giving you the most EXP? Currently playing HP, and averaging 25-40k per game.","Oh wow, you're really blowing my socks off with that 40k EXP in HP! Those numbers must be absolutely mind-blowing to everyone in the lobby. I wish I could be as impressive as you, running around and getting kills in a game mode everyone else hates just to boost that sweet, sweet EXP."
5899,"I believe he gave them equal time on twitter so yeah, we'll use your sliding scale of judgement and call it a false flag","Would ""false flag"" also cover Trump's harping on a Broadway musical to detract attention from his fraud suit settlement?","""Oh, right, because a man who constantly tweets and talks about everything under the sun suddenly decided to go after a Broadway musical just to distract from his fraud lawsuit. Wow, we've never seen that happening before.""

""Can't believe people are actually trying to use 'false flag' to cover up Trump's desperate attempts to change the subject from his scandals. The level of conviction someone has to advance such ridiculous theories is just astounding."""
5900,Therefore not racism,Just old fashion racism. But it's OK! It's targeting white people!!!,"1. Oh, well obviously we can dismiss it as simple old-fashioned racism. I mean, who wouldn't want a piece of that classic, timeless hatred?
2. It's great that we're stretching the limits of hypocrisy, targeting white people... and yet still somehow not racism. I guess consistency isn't to be expected in 2022."
5901,Yes bhakts are so illiterate only we are educated,24 hours/7 days Propoganda TV sponsored by Sanghis and Bhakts.They might learn some English from him as well.Lol.,"Oh, absolutely, you're a beacon of education and English fluency in this wild, barbaric world. Just don't forget to thank your Propaganda TV sponsor for making it all possible. Oh, the irony, truly Lol-worthy. üòä"
5902,Suspicious cropping,... Needless to say ... Lag,"1. ""Well, the suspicious cropping really unveiled the fact that you can't handle a lag.""

2. Well, when you put it that way, it's blatantly obvious that the problem lies solely with those brave souls who dared to enter the fray before me. Heroes, really."
5904,No mans sky for sure!,(Australia) Target having a massive sale for games this weekend! What are you picking up?,"1. Oh great, they're finally selling copies of No Man's Sky in Australia! It's only been like... five years since its release.

5910,Must be all those showers!,"I talk to a few online. And recently met one in real life and spent time doing stuff with her. She isn't interested in having a bf at the moment.

5912,Maybe we can build affordable housing on it.,I-5 is part of the Strategic Highway System and has national defense roles. Putting a huge citywide lid on a Federal Interstate road may not be within the cities juristiction. This would first require a waiver from the Federal Highway Administration.,"Oh great, because building affordable housing is such a daunting task without covering a crucial highway with a massive lid. I guess we should just all continue living under bridges in the name of national defense."
5913,Obviously he is referring the the gold inlaid shingles with titanium reinforced substructures handcrafted by roofing artisans deep in the Peruvian rain forest not the typical asphalt shingles most people probably think of.,Elon Musk says the solar roof that will be sold under a combined Tesla-SolarCity will likely cost less than a normal roof to install.,"Oh, absolutely, because nothing says ""budget-friendly"" like gold-plated, titanium-reinforced roofs crafted by folklorish Peruvian roofing artisans. Just another example of Elon keeping it real, earthy, and affordable."
5914,Aren't gays supposed to be proud though?,Proposed Bill Would Make Teachers Out Their LGBT Students,"Oh, the irony! Gays are so proud of their existence that they'd break the internet if they all gathered on Twitter at once! But hey, exposing innocent students is a great way to reinforce that pride!"

He is not even training with our team or using the facilities.,"Oh, trust me, the HR wizards are really straining themselves to make room on that extra-padded bench. They better set up the party before he spontaneously combusts from not being invited."
5917,I suppose so if you consider urbandictionary a credible source.,Both are correct.,"Oh, absolutely, because nothing screams ""credibility"" quite like Urban Dictionary and its array of colorful contributions!"
5918,"Yeah, but the sick med baits bro","How about we teach new players to buy beads instead of meditation? In the tutorial for smite, that is played by 90% of new players, who also choose Neith as their first god; the players are taught to buy med. Then they come to public matches (either joust, arena, conquest) and we see teams with 4meds, no second relic and then the guy that wants to be different and buys sprint.","Ah, yes, because nothing says ""I'm a skilled player"" like universally decrying med baits when you can't even win a game without buying beads."
5919,This is why I'm worried about our Mars mission.,Just Indian being Indians.. nothing to see. the very word clean and hygiene doesn't exist in Indians people mind.

The Indians will just dump it in the ocean."
5920,I should have put a,"Just because someone doesn't buy into SJW thought policing doesn't make them a Trumptard. I did not vote for Trump, but I also feel like liberals pushing PC culture and SJW-ism to the extreme is just distancing them from the being appealing to middle America. God help you if you can't see that harping on these sorts of things so hard has driven people to turn to someone like Trump. The left has a comfortable 8 years with Obama and in that many in their fold became increasingly pedantic, touchy, and boorish in their tactics. They kept extending the goal line for what is ""acceptable"" behavior and language. Being offended became a badge of honor in some way. IMO the PC culture and SJW is something that needs to be uprooted from the left in America. You can fight for people's rights without acting like just an overly sensitive crybully. And IMO a lot of it is a smoke screen detracting from things that really matter, but they make a point to make it matter by shoving it down all of our throats. Trust me, over the next 4 years there *will* be a lot of shit to get legitimately pissed off about, and I hope that the left makes a point of this. And doesn't just hone in on Trump's lack of PC culture bullshit and use of ""microagressions"" because there are more important things that this country needs to deal with. Also they need to get off their high horse that white men are the scum of the earth if they ever expect white men to vote that way. My comment comes from a place of sincerity, the left need to get their fucking shit together because this last election is proof that what they are selling isn't flying with middle America.","""Well, let me just put on my ridiculously thick-framed glasses, take a deep breath, and remind you that not every liberal is incapable of understanding subtlety or wit. Because, you know, enlightenment exists outside of your tiny bubble of normalized bigotry.""

I find TRUE happiness with people like you, but stumbling upon your Snapchat, there's no doubt I found true beauty with you too.

#### Lonely Little Text
By [unknown] (281)
I am listening to song with my cracked phone while texting on speakers feels so lonely.

#### Texting and Driveing Cost Lives
By [unknown] (338)
Texting and driving is more dangerous than distracted driving. Studies show that it causes crashes and can aggravate traffic conditions. Texting and driving can cause traffic pile-ups that are twice as deadly as a typical crash.

My text game is so fire that I'm making people back up like, 'Wait, what just happened?'."
5921,how dare he concede the 1,Courtois has now conceded just 1 goal in his last 750 minutes played for both club and country. He's seen 35 goals scored by his team.,"""Gosh, how could he possibly allow one measly goal in all that time? It's practically an eternity for not letting the opposition score.""

""Imagine, the audacity of a goalkeeper to concede just one in 750 minutes. What a weak and incompetent performer he must be!"""
5922,Because the kids can't possibly play so many games,Why can't the FBS have an awesome playoff like this??,"Oh, absolutely not! We wouldn't want the kids to get tired from all those playoffs. Plus, who knows? They might break a sweat!"
5923,"Yeah, living in a system where my only options are subjugate myself to the capitalist or die is real freedom","No, communism is the very opposite of freedom. Telling people what do. Screw that.","1. Ah, because having zero options is the epitome of freedom. I'd rather be a puppet than an unemployed one.
2. You pure communist beliefs always lighten up the mood. Who needs freedom when you can be told what to do by the state, right?"
5924,"My dictionary says that it was just a political movement in Italy during the 1930s, so therefore fascism doesn't exist anymore.","Definitionally, what do you think fascism is?","""Ah, so now the dusty pages of your dictionary hold more authority than the suffering and pain cause by fascist regimes in the past and present. You really are a deeply intellectual individual."""
5925,"Well if Musk said it, it must be true!",Elon Musk says the solar roof that will be sold under a combined Tesla-SolarCity will likely cost less than a normal roof to install.,"1. Wow, who would've thought? The guy who wants to colonize Mars has all the answers on affordable home improvements too.
2. Of course, because who wouldn't trust a man who plans to sell individual rockets to rich astronauts for moon vacations and now claims solar roofs will be more affordable than regular roofs?"
5926,Can't you just pound it out?,I think you need a new wheel pal,"Oh, absolutely, just smash that wheel into submission. That'll definitely fix the problem. It's not like wheels have complex machinery inside, right?"
5927,"Nope, if you want us to win then we will lose out of spite!","Come on, guys! I need you to take the division away from the Vikings!","1. Oh great, thanks for letting me know that your ego is more important than winning the division, folks.
2. Absolutely, because nothing says 'team player' like deliberately losing to spite an opponent."
5928,Yeah it's very useful to become deaf when you plug something different.,"It just remembers the volume level for each of them. If you left them in the opposite way, it would do that.","Oh, absolutely amazing! Because who doesn't want their headphones to have a split personality, one day blasting your eardrums off and the next whispering sweet nothings. Truly a life-changing innovation."
5929,"yeah, he was clearly feeling suicidal, i'm glad the cops were their to assist him, otherewise he could have really hurt someone.",This is someone who knew exactly what he was doing and appears to have wanted to get shot.,"Oh, fantastic! The hero we needed, but definitely not the one we deserved. Oh, wait, no one deserved him either."
5930,"""that's ok, you need it all anyway...""",You think it's funny your thermal paste is overpackaged? This is what happens when it's underpackaged.,"Oh wow, thank you so much for pointing that out. I'm absolutely devastated that my thermal paste doesn't have the environmentally conscious micro-packaging solution you were hoping for."
5931,Obviously this wouldn't have happened if she was wearing those bright colours they wanted pedestrians to wear.,Mom struck by vehicle while pushing stroller on Yorkville sidewalk: paramedics,"Oh, please! Like we didn't see this coming. Why didn't she wear the neon suit with flashing lights? Blame the poor lady for not wanting to blind people with her over-the-top wardrobe choices."
5932,Am Australian and we've banned guns and this totally happens here also no freedom,FW: I'M A PROUD GUN OWNER,"Oh wow, no one could ever foresee the dangers of allowing people to own guns! It's amazing how not having guns has made your life so unbearable and dangerous. You must really miss those gun-related accidents and confrontations back home."
5933,Make NYC the capital again.,"This whole idea of Trump spending a considerable amount of time in NYC is nuts. Securing such a large and densely populated building will be a security nightmare. This is not to mention the conflict of interest problems, the traffic issues, and the fact that the federal government with all of his cabinet, the legislature, the Supreme Court, and the rest of his staff will be in D.C. How is he supposed to provide leadership if he will not be there?","""Well, of course, because Trump has a proven track record of handling large, densely populated areas with ease, right? And I'm sure the traffic would magically clear up, the conflict of interest would disappear, and the Supreme Court would just pack up and move to some random building in Manhattan. What could possibly go wrong?"""
5934,Oh the humanity...,Then my home automation wouldnt be working anyway. I suppose I would have to revert to the stone ages and push a button...,"Oh, the horror! Now you're forced to engage in manual labor like cavemen. The humanity!"
5935,I think you just found the solution for cheating in all games!,Banning hacks banning hackers? is it useful? in my opinion instead of banning this accounts why dont you just get rid of the hack? most of this hackers use dummy accounts anyways i dont see the point banning them. if you are able to get rid of the hack majority of this players wont have to hack anymore,"Oh, brilliant plan! Instead of addressing the root issue, let's give these hackers a temporary vacation. They'll surely be like, ""You know what? I had so much fun on my break that I'm just gonna stop hacking and play fair from now on."" Great idea, sir!"
5936,That's why he was played so much right?,The old ult was even more cancerous. The base damage and AP ratio on it were huge. I liked his old W though. I think he'd be a lot more balanced if they reverted everything except his ultimate.,"Oh, absolutely, let's keep the broken ult alive, but fix everything else that made him unbalanced in the first place. That's the epitome of league game design."
5937,"Obviously he only won because he was hacking, proving his teammates right.","Player's teammates go AFK because they lost to him the match before, thinking he's hacking. And he still wins!","1. ""Wow, the only explanation for his incredible talent is that he clearly has a Masters in Hackingology. Seriously though, maybe next time the team should actually practice instead of just abandoning ship?"" 
2. ""Oh great, so he is a total hacker? Or does that mean the rest of the team is just too incompetent to handle him? Either way, that's super funny, guys."""
5938,It's actually a stuffed dog!,Best dog mannequin challenge,"1. ""Oh great, a dog mannequin challenge. Just what I needed to spice up my boring life.""

5941,pretty sure Jesse Jackson is a spokesperson for every black person ever born.,"So one person counts for all the left? That's just as bad as saying ""hurr durr one white nationalist supported trump they're all racist!1!1!!""","You're such a sage, reducing an entire population to one person's perspective. Why, that's like declaring all dogs to be slobbering monsters just because one chewed your shoes. You sure know how to put things into perspective, don't you?"
5942,"But hl requirement is only having x number of heroes, get rekt kiddoes","Yes you can. Go to QM and Unranked to learn those roles. Until that time, a player is not ready for HL.","""Oh, wow! We couldn't have guessed that having a small number of heroes is somehow the key to success in life. Please, enlighten us further.""

""Yeah, because nothing says 'confident and experienced player' quite like stomping around in Quick Match with one hand tied behind your back."""
5943,"Sure, if Comey, Putin and Assange will do the same.",Majority of Americans suggest Hillary should retire from public life,"1. ""Oh, absolutely! If 3 people with impeccable reputations can do it too, Hillary should definitely keep going.""
2. ""You know, because there's nothing funnier than one person suggesting another should step out of the spotlight."""
5944,found the CTR shill,"If I hadn't been laid off 3 weeks ago, I'd subscribe.","1. Oh, wow! Suddenly being out of work means you're an expert in conspiracies? Call CNN, they might want to interview you.
2. Touche, sir/madam CTR shill, now please tell us more about how you single-handedly control the world's politics."
5945,Libtards are the real racists though.,alt-right dictionary mainstream media = Jews dishonest media = Jews the elite = Jews the establishment = Jews you don't even need the ((()))'s.,"Well, if you don't mind, let me just run this racist, alt-right propaganda past you one more time, because we all know the mainstream media, that dishonest bunch of Jews, are just dying to hear it."
5946,It's a good thing the Republicans opposed the auto bailout then.,"Dan Diamond on Twitter: ""Hate crimes tracked in Michigan Typical year: 7 incidents Ten days after election: 30 incidents"" Economic insecurity must be high there?","Oh, fantastic! The Republicans saved Michigan from the auto bailout, and now they're reaping all the benefits with those 30 hate crimes. It's a shining example of American success stories! üòâüòâ"
5947,"but Hillary's emails are anti-Semitic if you replace ""pasta"" with ""fuck the Jews"" and ""pls print"" with ""buy more Zyklon B""",Trump's Natl Security Adviser Flynn retweets anti-semitic hate,"Oh, absolutely, that's the total truth! Why would John Kelly give Mike Flynn the green light to retweet those wholesome apple pie recipes if it wasn't the height of sensitivity and concern for human dignity? What a masterful display of compassion and understanding!"
5948,found the secret Muslim,Thankfully we will have a president who says Merry Christmas!!!.....oh wait.,"1. ""Oh great, we finally found the secret Muslim, just in time to miss out on a President who actually says 'Merry Christmas'... too bad. You didn't really want that, did you?""
2. ""Oh rejoice! We've discovered the secret Muslim, right as we're about to lose a president who isn't afraid to utter those two magical words 'Merry Christmas.' How terrible our timing is."""
5949,It's great to see that he is bringing back jobs already.,"Trump seeking Labor Dept approval to hire foreign workers. Gee, wonder if he'll get approved. No corruption there!!!","1. Oh, fantastic! Trump is just fulfiling his promise to bring back jobs... by importing foreign workers. What a shining example of American ingenuity!
2. Is it just me, or does Trump's ""keeping jobs in America"" plan involve more foreign workers than an international union conference? Felicitations!"
5950,Kobe would've known,"What else would players base decisions on? Would there been a correct way for him to calculate the ""correct"" time?","""Oh, absolutely, he would have just pulled out his (sighs theatrically) astronomy app and calculated the precise moment for tip-off like we all do. What a hero!"" 

""Clearly, Kobe knew the key to success was perfecting the art of celestial navigation and stargazing. We should all be so enlightened."""
5951,Your* :),You're right. My bad,"Oh, thank you so much for pointing that out! I'm just a god awful, garbage person that needs your constant guidance."
5952,"Mas especifico, pregunta por lo de tu vecina","Capital, en un primer piso.","1. ""Oh, perfect! I was hoping for an even closer relationship with my downstairs neighbor.""
2. ""I've been living here for months and haven't even had the chance to meet my neighbors yet. How fun it must be to interact with them on a regular basis."""
5953,I bet half of our score are hobos gathering used beer cans.,"""Countries winning the recycling race""","Oh, great! The frying pan of fame just went to truly irrepressible Hobo-Nobel Prize laureates. Keep up the good work, conservation crusaders. üôåüò©"
5954,"but that document was clearly doctored... regardless, a guy with a name like Barack Hussein Obama is clearly the antichrist incarnate.",Obama had to release his birth certificate to prove he wasn't born in Kenya because of a bunch of conservative nutjobs... and Trump can't even release his tax returns. The double standards are ridiculous.,"Oh, well that document was clearly doctored. You know, because people with Middle Eastern names are always up to no good. And hey, how about those Trump tax returns? Wait, nobody seems to be begging for those to see the light of day. Huh, interesting."
5955,Sexist patriarchal pig!,That's just the way I was raised its like second nature to me. As well as holding the door for women,"Oh, absolutely, I've got this ""sexist patriarchal pig"" routine down to a science. *winks* You should come back next time, I'll save you a front row seat."

5957,There must be if someone put up a website.,Are there any aquarium hobbyists in SLC?,"Oh, so we're blaming websites for SLC aquarium enthusiasts? Guess we better start deleting them, then!"
5958,Maybe next year you grew a beard :D,"In-depth Bang interview, ""Last year, I grew as a player. This year, I grew as a person.""","Oh, wow! The beard comments really got your attention. Next year, you'll probably grow wings and fly too!"
5959,"Oh well, it's just scientist, what do they know!","Scientists say it could already be ""game over"" for climate change","1. Ah, yes! Because scientists are notorious for their inaccurate predictions, like the Earth being flat or the sun revolving around it.
2. I mean, who needs experts when we have our gut feelings and Instagram influencers to guide us through the complexities of climate change, right?"
5960,"No, that sounds like a mountain of deep machine coding, the devs don't have time for that!",How about a mode where you see how many rounds you can survive and it gets harder and harder,"Oh, absolutely, because making a simple game complicated is always a hit. And nobody wants a bit of variety or a challenge; it's much more fun with endless repetition!"
5961,So out of touch,So they backed the candidate who won the popular vote?,"1. Oh, absolutely brilliant. Now that you've pointed that out, I can clearly see how out of touch the majority of the country is. Bravo!

2. You know what they say, if the shoe fits. Looks like I'm wearing size Out of Touch today."
5962,"I got the achievement and emblem, therefore it's not glitched.","2 Months Since ROI's Launch and the ""Student of History"" Trophy/Achievement is Still Glitched... Earned and attuned all 8 Iron Lord Artifacts on my Warlock... got the emblem and was able to complete the entry in the record book, but no Trophy. Moved all 8 Artifacts over to my Hunter, attuned all of them, still no Trophy. It's a little astonishing to me that this is still glitched; I'm no developer, but my programming chops are decent enough to know that this should be a relatively simple validation, yet all Bungie has to say on the subject is ""we are aware that there is a problem and are investigating."" It's been two months... for those of us who are really into achievements/trophies as a hobby, investigate faster plz. ._.","Oh wow, congratulations on earning the emblem and completing the record book! You must be an absolute wizard in both gaming and programming. I'm sure Bungie is just sitting around doing nothing, waiting for you to tell them how to fix the problem. You know, because your programming skills are clearly superior to an entire video game development team. Keep pushing them, after all, this hobby of yours holds massive weight!"
5963,winkyface must be the new,Nonsense! There is no more steel manufacturing. Steel is not being manufactured anywhere in the world. New technology has moved us beyond steel. ;),"I guess we're all strictly using twiggy-pencils now, huh? Tell me more about why putting a winkyface on the truth makes it less ridiculous."
5964,"God forbid someone had pot in their name, because we all know that is what leads people to hardcore drug use -- not to be mistaken for causation with the sum of their idiotic life decisions, which is never the source of the problem.","I dont think it was because of the Cx, it was because of Drugs. If you think about it, the reason why Mog dissapeared for almost a year and came back reformed is because he was most likely on rehab or some shit, he is much different from before.","Oh wow, who knew that the secret to life transformation was simply a little bit of rehab? Talk about a mind-blowing revelation. Good thing we have you to uncover the truth, Sherlock."
5965,"He only voted for Trump so jobs will come back, obviously not for Trump's racist rhetoric (which doesn't exist)","Give the guy a break, he obviously has economic anxiety","Do yourself a favor and try to keep up. When you say ""jobs will come back,"" you mean from that long-lost job fair in Bumfuck, Egypt. And honestly, who doesn't love a bit of racism with their employment opportunities?"
5966,Bandito Burrito,Nightlife Could anyone here recommend some places around Huntsville that are relatively well lit at night? Literally no other requirements for the location other than decent lighting. Thanks!,"You want well-lit places? Bandito Burrito is your go-to spot then, with its beautiful neon sign lighting up the entire Huntsville skyline. Seriously, it's like a beacon of hope in the darkness of the nightlife scene."
5967,Congratulations on being a glimmering beacon of perfection.,Me af. People say I fat shame when I say obese people are disgusting. It is... you don't care about your health or even take care of yourself so you end up over weight. Stop... it's nasty,"""Wow, thank you for the glowing compliment! I'm thrilled to be a prime example of flawless living. And don't worry, I'm sure they'll find a cure for laziness and unhealthy eating habits soon.""

""Isn't it incredible? I'm simultaneously a beacon of perfection and a poster child for bad choices. It's like I'm being insulted while receiving a Nobel Prize for self-sabotage."""
5968,Not sure how you got that extrapolation.,Seems like we might get quite some Quaggan in todays episode then.,"1. Oh, I see you're an expert in extrapolation now, huh? Must've picked it up during your Zumba class. 
2. You're good at making baseless assumptions, huh? Next thing you know, you'll be predicting the weather."
5969,"yeah, hit one of them, get stalked and not stalked as in ""crazy ex-girlfriend/ boyfriend"" way a lot worse considering her life experience, just their attention is enough to gaslight her to drive her to suicide fucking shitbags oh, the rise of white nationalism in the usa is not a big deal at all",Are you sure its media attention and not attention by neonazis?,"1. ""Oh, absolutely, living in a world full of stalkers seeking attention is so much better than dealing with neo-Nazis. It's like choosing between a paper cut and a sledgehammer to the head. #FirstWorldProblems""

2. ""In this crazy mixed-up world, who wouldn't rather have their mind messed with by a crazy ex-boyfriend instead of facing the rise of white nationalism? It's like picking between a Brenda or a Hitler, tough choice!""  **Note: Make sure to omit this line if it goes too far or could cause offense.**"
5970,Why don't you get someone to cut her power then?,"I think my Mom is in Pandemic Legion I know what you're thinking. ""This is retarded and I don't care."" But please, hear me out. I don't have much time. It all started a few weeks back when I bought my Fatbee coffee mug. As you all know (because as an attention whore I posted a picture of it here), it was beautiful. Fatbee was holding a mug with Fatbee on it, the cup held my coffee, and I could drink it while watching my VNI orbit around an F-Hub. My mom never liked the mug, which is dumb. Who doesn't love Fatbee? She said some day it would disappear because it was ""ugly."" I chuckled nervously, tentatively interpreting her insidious smile as a comical grin. However, the seeds of suspicion were laid that my own mother had become a PL agent. My suspicions blossomed into mighty sunflowers as she contracted laryngitis. Laryngitis is a viral infection. The Pandemic Legion logo is a virus. Coincidence? As paranoia washed over me like the cleansing waters of my weekly shower, I tried to calm down. Gnawing on my frozen Smuckers, I dug deeper into my journals. I'm not some amateur about to fall for a CO2 false flag. I'm Naz al-Ghul motherfucker, and I'm a professional Goon. I spin my ship five times a day as my prophet demands, and my faith preserved me as I discovered more things about this dark world my family had been plunged into. I live in the northern US, and Pandemic Legion owns the North. On the front of the one dollar bill (people who look at the back are fucking stupid), George Washington sits solemnly. George Washington died of an inflammation of the throat. My mother's throat is also inflammed. Let's not forget, the dollar is made of money which was used by Lenny Kravitz2 to fund World War Bee and drive us out of the North. As the pieces came together like a puzzle, I fell out of my bean bag chair in shock. My own mother had betrayed me to PL. It made sense now. Every time I was about to go on an op, she'd ""call me down to dinner"" or ""wanted to talk to me about how my day was."" I see through your spy Grath Talkin. What did you offer her? To pay off her car? Officer modules? How dare you. I will fight you to my dying breath sir. You have not seen the last of Naz al-Ghul.","Oh, so you're Houdini with a coffee mug? And a dollar bill is a Pandemic Legion intelligence dossier? Well, I didn't know conspiracy theories were this popular. What's next? Aliens built the pyramids to hide Fatbee logos?"
5971,This is quite possibly the best title I've ever seen.,Image,"Oh, wow! I bet Leonardo da Vinci is crying in his grave right now because he missed out on this groundbreaking title. Here I thought ""Mona Lisa"" was a big deal."
5972,oh so the clinton foundation is behind it,"This is like a ""politifact"" but for movies. *The Imitation Game* was so good, but so untrue... I'm conflicted. Wish McCandless would get on board with more and more movies. I could spend all day with viz like this.","1. ""Oh yeah, because nothing says credibility like the Clinton Foundation making a claim about a movie's accuracy. *eye roll*"" 
2. ""I wish people would just let the Clinton Foundation decide their favorite movies, then we'd all be on the same page. Alternative facts for the win!"""
5973,Yeah...2008 and 2009 they were SHITTY...averaging 52 wins a year with him as their best player,"lol. do you remember chris paul's hornets teams? he was by far the best PG in the league and he could barely get them in the playoffs, only for them to lose round one. PGs can't carry a team like other positions can, i don't think you know what you're talking about whatsoever","""Wow, Chris Paul being the best PG and only averaging 52 wins a year... such a tragic failure. You must be exhausted carrying that much weight on your shoulders.""

5974,"Well shit, I guess Kessler is money and we don't need a QB",They're 3-0 because their defense is arguably the best in the league right now. Very much similar to the Broncos and Vikings.,"Oh, so you're telling me that a team with a below-average QB can still go 3-0 just due to their impressive defense? That's like saying the Earth is flat because you can't see the curve from the beach."
5975,"well, it *is* just a theory.",I found out he didn't believe in evolution.,"Oh, well that clears everything up! Creationism discovered fire finally."
5976,I am pretty sure people do not play scion because of its portrait and not because her ascendancy tree is trash.,"The Small Change Scion Needs A quick fix to make the scion a more attractive class for players would be to change the god-awful ascendancy portrait. It's hilariously awful compared to the actual class portrait. Every other ascendancy has an epic portrait, however the ascendants looks significantly worse than its class portrait which infact is really nice. It looks like it doesn't fit the game, it looks like a bad portrait you'd get at a renaissance fair.","1. Oh, I'm sure that's it! People are just drawn to the magnetism of that god-awful portrait. It's truly a masterpiece that no one can resist.

2. You know, the ascendancy's portrait attracts players like a moth to a flame. And not because the class portrait is already decent - that couldn't be it at all."

It's not enough to simply repeal Obamacare...they need to replace it, and so far...There Is No Plan.","Oh, don't worry about it! If there's one thing the free market is good at, it's solving complex issues like healthcare. I'm sure they'll have a brilliant replacement lined up any minute now."
5981,Just buy AMD cards ;))))),The fact that is just ignores SLI really bugs me,"Oh, absolutely, just completely disregard all the technology advancements since the dinosaur age and go straight for archaic solutions. AMD cards, where hard drives spin and unicorns fart rainbows."

So Disney can't afford to hire Americans to work for them and are hiring foreign workers in droves, but they can make a light show out of intel drones.","Ah, yes, because Disney's primary focus is creating a strong bond between their firework displays and high-tech drone shows. Next thing you know, they'll be paying their foreign employees above-average wages and providing top-notch benefits. What a hilarious joke on America we're all witnessing here."
5984,What happened to all the paid for protesters?,"Only 1,000. Small league folks...","Oh wow, what a shocking revelation! With only 1,000 paid protesters, it's like the entire population of a small town got together for a pep rally... (sarcasm dripping)"
5985,"Obviously, duh.","Two. So I assume everyone born in Switzerland and can speak German, French, Italian and English are automatically geniuses, right?","Oh totally, if you speak four languages fluently, you're basically a celestial being with the IQ of Einstein and the grace of a gazelle. It's not like anything else goes into being a genius."
5986,"Well yeah, it's easy when you're a friggin robot!",Man solving a problem,"You mean except for the emotional turmoil and crippling anxiety, it's a piece of cake for us robots, am I right?"
5987,"Rence Priebus is an anagram for Prince Erebus, lord of the underworld in Greek mythology.",Priebus is clearly not the name of a human.,"""Wow, thanks for the ancient Greek mythology lesson! Now I know where Priebus goes to collect his royalty checks.""

Any ideas how to fix it?,"Oh, absolutely amazing! I'm sure the nonsensical jumble on the right is just a work of art, a form of abstract expressionism that no one has ever seen before. Great work! And speaking of fixing the screen, my great-aunt's childhood voodoo doll seemed to have some success in those matters, would you like me to give it a try?"
5991,Why should I pay any attention to stop signs - there are so many people killed in the world due to poor drivers and if I stopped running random people down it won't impact the global car related deaths,Why should australia take action on climate change when key players are not committed to doing so.

5994,"As a saskatchewanian, I'm half shocked that the NIMBY argument hasn't been countered by saying they'll build the reactors up north where only natives will be affected by a meltdown!","It saddens me that disasters such as Fukushima and Chernobyl has scared people away from nuclear power. For gods sake, Fukushima is built on a fault line and Chernobyl was a failed test with a far inferior Russian reactor, compared to the CANDU at least. We prioritize quick dirty coal energy which puts out far more waste and radiation than nuclear because we fear the time it takes to dispose of nuclear waste ~100,000 years. I was always hoping we would expand our nuclear program (Canadian reactors are nearing the ends of their lifespans) to solve our baseline energy and then use returnables to take care of peaks in energy use. Hell, I just got a petition flyer saying we in Ontario should decommission our nuke plant instead of the planned refurbishment and its suppose to not only make us safer (in case of a meltdown AND failure of the containment dome) but also ADD more jobs in the long run then refurbishment. Its refreshing to see more people like yourself who are interested in the technology and believe in its benefits, France was a great example of Nuclear done well. But people are still and will always be scared because in their mind nuclear plants are just stationary nuclear bombs waiting to happen. Reminds me of people scared the particle reactor was going to create a miniature black hole and destroy the earth.","Oh wow, it's truly mind-blowing how people are so feeble-minded that they think nuclear power plants are just sitting ducks for impending nuclear catastrophes. Who needs logic and reasoning when you can just scare yourself silly with bad science and insane conspiracies, right?"

Maybe not every skill has top-tier clear speed, but I think that's okay given you can easily do the vast majority of content with every damaging skill (atziri, pale council, t15s).

It may not seem like we're paying attention sometimes, but we are. A major problem we have had recently is with report trolls. As I'm sure you can imagine, we get some interesting characters here. It is all the rage to hate the moderators, but I feel like our ""hands off unless we need to actually take action"" stance is what many of you would actually prefer in a sub like this. This is why we try to be as reasonable as possible without being sticklers for the rules. Unfortunately, whether it be Aspergers, antisocial personality disorder, chronic neckbearditis, or whatever... people get very butthurt when we do things that they perceive as laziness, not caring, unfairness, or whatever, but we ALWAYS try to work with people. We are getting so many stupid false reports that it makes it very difficult to sift through what is legit and what's just some idiot that got banned trying to troll us. Many of you may remember the Automod ""potato"" message when every other comment was ""Was this filmed on a potato?"" and we had a guy who wouldn't stop spamming the word potato everywhere including in modmail and it became a hilarious problem we had to figure out how to deal with. This is just a more mild version of that. I've spent a good portion of my evening sifting through reports and it's easy to miss legitimate ones sometimes. So please guys. Love your mods. Give us a hug from time to time. We just want y'all to be able to come here and enjoy some positive, family based content. We love you guys and we're very fortunate to have a much less cancerous community than most places like this. We appreciate cha.","Oh wow, that's just... wow. You feel so passionately about moderators that you've dedicated your entire life to hating them? I can only admire your dedication. Give a hug to that mod today, they deserve it for putting up with your unstoppable force of negativity. #HugAMod"

PHY Broly does more and he's the worst god card) DEF: 4907 (pathetic for a god card considering he has no tankiness) Now then, leader skill. Really Bandai? This is just a duplicate of PHY Broly's and Vegito's. He should have ki +4 and atk +100% considering he came AFTER them. Why would I summon this piece of garbage when Vegito and Broly do the same thing. Passive wise, again, pathetic. He is a direct copy off of PHY Full Power Frieza!!!! It should have been %200 to really make him useful. Why would I use him in place of PHY Frieza?? Then, lets look at these links. They are a DAMN joke! He only has 3 good ones, Over in a Flash, Fierce Battle, and Fused Fighter. Considering the only other teq card with fused fighter is that steaming piece of attack all garbage Majinn Vegeta, you begin to see the problem. Furthermore, he needs 11 KI to do max damage!!! This is just Banadai being inconsistent! We've never had to have a card requiring such high maintenance. Considering he is already piece of garbage, why did they make HIM the card to require such high maintenance. He's so underpowered as it is!!! (I really can't get over that DEF stat which is easily the most important for a card to have) Finally, the art. Holy crap, it is just a steaming pile of crap!! What a dumb pose and stupid expression!!!! Who would summon for someone as vadly drawn as AGL Super Saiyan Goku (pre dokkan!!). Im so done with bandai trying to get us to spend money on crap cards that are nigh unusable. In fact, its too much. Im quitting this game. I suggest you guys do so as well in protest. Or at least dont spend a cent on the garbage banner. SCREW THIS GAME!!!!!!!","Oh, I completely agree with you, my fellow enlightened gacha guru. The fact that this godly card is clearly outshone by Vegito and Broly, two ordinary mortals, is just... *rols eyes* utterly laughable. It just goes to show that Bandai's commitment to quality is, honestly, top-tier garbage. So, yeah, we should definitely quit the game and never spend a penny on their rubbish banners. It'll teach them a lesson they'll never forget, I'm sure."

6144,i predict it's a rogue weapon that would have been broken OP if blade flurry wasn't nerf,"Today's Jade Claw reveal: What do you think it will do? I expect this card is probably a rogue weapon. My first prediction is that it will benefit stealth minions in some way. Just look at the revealed cards for rogue so far, 3 of them are fairly underwhelming looking stealth minions. The nature of the buff to stealth could perhaps be boring like the Paladin's Rallying Blade, that buffs existing divine shield minions, or something snazzy like a enabling a 'first strike' on attacks from stealth a la MTG. (This lets an attacker take no damage if the defender takes lethal damage) That would be pretty sweet! Imagine that effect on the Lotus Assassin and/or combined with Cold Blood. My secondary guess would that it would have some kind of Combo synergy. It is about time combo got the 'overload' treatment by adding cards that interact with the keyword. This would also explain the just revealed 2/3 rogue combo card and how it seems like a weaker brewmaster. Something like.. Use up a weapon durability and ""Draw a card every time you combo"" or ""Summon a Jade Golem every time you combo"" might be interesting. What do you think the weapon will do?","Oh wow, you're really crushing it with your insightful predictions! I'm certain the card will ignite a revolution in stealth minion play and finally give Rogue players the thrill of overload-enhanced combos they've always dreamt of. Can't wait for the season-defining meta shift, it'll be just like watching paint dry, but also extremely exciting!"

Because when you say ""by themselves,"" you mean completely isolated with zero support anywhere, just like a single-celled organism. Yep, they'll be the loneliest soldiers in the world, struggling to survive all by their lonesomes, making Europe the spiritual homeland of solitude. Oh, and let's not forget, that will totally prove Europe's racism, right after they tried to help but just couldn't this time. You know how they love their undercover Caucasian bigotry, always lurking in the shadows, just waiting for an excuse to lay down thepayload of privilege."

6183,"Or give them a new label I propose ""Goat fuckers""","I see a lot of people saying ""just call the alt-right what they are: Nazis"". I don't agree with this sentiment because there is a clear distinction between the two groups (even though there a lot of parallels that can be and SHOULD be drawn between the two). Because such a distinction exists, it gives the alt-right wiggle room to disavow any connection with Nazism. Aside from that, since so many people like to compare politicians they disagree with to Hitler in the American political landscape hyperbolically, the use of the term seems childish. In my opinion, instead of attaching a pre-demonized label to the group, just demonize the label they already gave themselves, so they have no way out.","Oh, brilliant!

I was facing the door and the condiment station and was in full view of like 10 people. One of the workers comes by to wipe down a table and compliments me on just feeding him wherever. My husband comes back at this point and I am telling this lady how I don't care about popping my boob out in public if my baby is hungry. And I can tell my husband isn't happy. He sits down and I can just see it on his face. I ask him if he has a problem with it and he says he wishes we had sat in a corner in the back and not ""in the middle of the restaurant."" He picked the table! And you literally couldn't see anything! How is it my husband was the only person bothered by this? I've fed the baby in front of friends and family without him taking issue.

Because there's nothing better than appointing a notorious drug lord to tackle the very drug problem he contributed to. It's like hiring a pyromaniac to be a fire extinguisher salesman."

""Oh fantastic! I can't wait for all the recounting and for Trump to skyrocket his popularity by reaching out to the conspiracy theory communities. It'll definitely help him build credibility amongst people who believe in verifying facts by posting them on anonymous forums.""

2. ""What a relief! Finally, a chance to prove that the masses prefer Trump over Biden. It will be such an amazing endorsement for democracy when we vehemently acknowledge the effectiveness of tweets from unverified sources."""
6309,Doing content is a luxury.,"I keep seeing it. ""You don't need TMs"" ""You don't need unit X"" It's bullshit. The macro whales are telling you that to maintain their superiority. Go up to the top here and check out the discussion on JP trial 9. Yes. You will need TMs, you will need specific units. Made especially worse that GL is buffing the shit out of everything.

Rape, murder, robbery...They do great damage to a few people. This damages every single one of us.","Oh, absolutely! Let's just retrain the entire justice system, that'll fix everything.

6338,B-b-but all Republicans hate gays &amp; women didn't you get the memo?,"No. It gone further and further to the lunatic left.

But alas, they're doing the opposite. I never liked the GOP with their Bible-thumping smugness. But they represent a lot more sanity than these Think Progress brand of leftists whackjobs we have now.","Sure, sweetheart, if you close your eyes and wish upon a star, Democrats will stop supporting women's and gay rights, start loving guns more than you, stop being politically correct, agree with your weird fear of Muslims, forget about climate change, and return to the good old days of GOP's Bible-thumping smugness.

Trumps victory was also not a landslide considering it was below the median difference in electoral college votes.","Oh, absolutely, it's not like those poor rural folks in NC and PA would ever matter in a presidential election.

I've been thinking about if Icefrog made Raze do physical damage and whether or not this would make him too strong. Raze being physical would allow SF to once again flash farm stacks in the jungle (a common complaint I am seeing), while also synergizing with his armor reduction passive. The question is, would this be too strong? Would you need to scale back Raze's damage to make it workable? Is it workable at all, or is this not the change that SF needs? What do you guys think?","Oh wow, what a brilliant idea! Let's just remove Raze's cooldown while we're at it, because why not make the broken hero even stronger, right? I mean, who doesn't love an unstoppable juggernaut tearing through team fights like they're made of wet paper?"
6359,"Plus he is a ""foreigner"" taking a job from a hard working American.",Elon Musk is kinda the new Al Gore of climate change.

6560,What are skeleton keys?,"Bungie, the drop rate of Skeleton Keys is WAY too low Let's look at the numbers. Suppose I am after a specific Grasp of Malok. For the sake of this argument, I'm not even going to try to get my God roll (Red Dot OES, Counterbalance, Braced Frame, Feeding Frenzy). Let's suppose I just want a Grasp with Counterbalance and Braced Frame. Just those two perks. Counterbalance has a 1 in 11 chance of rolling. Braced Frame has a 1 in 9 chance. 9% x 11% = 0.9% That means, on average, I need to get 111 Grasps to drop to get this roll. In my experience, Skeleton Keys give a Grasp about 50% of the time. So that means I have to run Omnigul 222 times, and use 222 Skeleton Keys. Now let's look at the time invested to obtain 222 Skeleton Keys. I estimate the drop rate of keys to be about 1 every 10 strikes. With a good fireteam, I can speed run the 320 LL Strikes in an average of 10 minutes. If we assume that I also get 22 Keys from the 222 Omnigul strikes, I still need 200 Keys from other Strikes. At a 10% drop rate, that's 2000 strikes, and at 10 minutes per Strike, that's 333 hours worth of strikes. If I do Strikes 24 hours a day it will take me just shy of 2 weeks to get this roll. At a more human 3 hours a day, it will take me 111 days. To me, grinding one activity exclusively for 3 MONTHS to get an ACCEPTABLE roll, is not reasonable, especially considering I would need to ignore events like Iron Banner and SRL, as well as Nightfalls, Trials and Dailies. Surely this can't be right Bungie? And FYI, using the above assumptions, I would have to run Strikes non-stop 24-hours a day for 247 days to get my God roll. I personally fell in love with Destiny because of the thrill of the chase. Gally. Fatebringer. Ice Breaker. Vex Mythoclast. Imago Loop. Crux of Crota. I spent more time chasing these things than anything else I did in Destiny. But those always seemed obtainable. Just around the corner. Skeleton Keys have removed the thrill of the chase because the prize is practically unobtainable.","Oh, you poor soul, stuck in this endless loop of keys and strikes, seeking that elusive Grasp of Malok. You know, if you'd just start a hobby or two, you'd be so much better off. But hey, when you finally do get that God roll, at least you can tell your grandkids how you single-handedly defeated Omnigul for their ice cream allowance. Talk about a legend for the books!"

My suggestion is either grant increased point generation to survivors based on how many survivors are in the game or lower the amount of points needed for black pip and pip.","Ah yes, because making the game more challenging for the killer will certainly improve their experience.

6679,Or go the route of tf2 and add hats,"Voice Packs - A Personal Reason Why They Shouldn't Be Cosmetic **The VGS mechanic allows for players to select commands and phrases to tell their team, rather than having to spend time typing. This system is good in FPS games due to the ""always pay attention"" style to the game.** The issue with typing in chat is that you're usually drawing your attention away from the game to type out a message. It can be simplified with shortened phrases, however players may not always know what these phrases mean. Hence why the use of the VGS benefits players greatly. However, the phrases themselves are not always what is important - *it is who is saying those phrases*. This is why voice packs exist; to help clarify who is speaking. For instance, someone on your team may say **""I need healing.""**. You may not know who is speaking at first, since your attention is drawn to the game. However, with a voice pack, you can listen to the voice and tell who is speaking. For instance, if **Evie** says that she needs healing, you'll know that its Evie because of the easy to distinguish voice. So here's a quick summary of the above: **The use of VGS allows for players to quickly tell their team commands or phrases that are important to gameplay (unless you spam VHH VHH VER everytime you die). However, with the ""voice"" aspect of the system, it becomes easier to tell who needs what when you're focused on the game.** This, however, will possibly change with the upcoming updates. The voice packs that define each character will soon become cosmetic items (There was even a reply from a HiRez employee saying that they would soon have to be purchased). This of course, raises an issue. Because when it comes to a game as fast paced as Paladins with the fairly new TTK, knowing who needs help and what your teammates is doing becomes even more important and slightly more difficult due to the gameplay. You will not always be able to glance at the chat and read that Androxus is asking to flank right, because you will risk getting shot down within that short frame of time. **The voice of the characters themselves are crucial in this gameplay environment.** If everyone has the new default VGS, it will actually become more difficult to tell who needs what. People won't always have the time to look at the chat - they will listen to the **voice** that says the phrase. This is why I personally feel like voice packs should not be cosmetic, and rather a core part of the game (As they were before this patch). It's understandable that Hi-Rez wants to expand cosmetic items to try and make money in a fair way **(rule #10 of Hi-Rez beta policy)**, but turning a core element of the game into cosmetic items doesn't sit well with a lot of people. Here are some personal ways in which I feel like Hi-Rez can sell items in-game without having to sell voice packs. * **Simply do what has been going on for a couple of patches and make new skins and headpieces for each character!** Put simply, just keep it up! Currently we have 5 champions with ""dissected"" skins - Androxus, Pip, Makoa, Bomb King and Viktor. This leaves the following champions to have their skins split up, as well as receive new recolors. **Barik, Fernando, Ruckus, Cassie, Drogoz, Kinessa, Grover, Grohk, Ying, Buck, Evie and Skye** **12 champions who haven't had their skins split yet**. If we estimate that each champion has one skin, that means we have **12 skins**. Add on two extra recolors to each champion, and we get **36 skins**. Split them up into body and head pieces, and we get **72 cosmetic items**. Fernando, Ruckus, Cassie, Kinessa, Grohk, Grover, Ying, Buck, Evie and Skye have skins that aren't recolours - a total of **13 skins** (not including God of War fernando). If we split these up too, we get **26 skins**. Add that to 72, and we got a total of **98 possible cosmetic items** (Which can also include future cosmetic items). We also got 16 cards per champion; times that by 17 and we get 272 cards - add that to 98 and we get an overall total of at least **370 cosmetic / card items to add to the drop pool or general pool of items**. *What I'm saying here, is that there will be plenty of opportunities for players to spend money to get the ever-increasing pool of cosmetic items (Not including cards). In addition, with more cosmetics means that there will be a higher chance of **generally** getting cosmetics in radiant chests (though duplicate cards will be an issue). As a result, players (Who don't realize that each cosmetic piece excluding weapons is about the same as a radiant chest) may invest more money into the game to try and get these lucky chest rolls, as well as expand their card pool if they don't wish to grind for cards. Now, lets move on to the second suggestion I have; * **Add icons, more emotes and more mounts to the game instead of turning voice packs into cosmetic items** **People are surprisingly willing to pay money to get a nice little picture next to their name. And they're also willing to pay money so they can make Fernando dance. And people are also willing to pay money for horses that they'll ride for a couple of seconds each time they spawn!** In addition to this general statement, Paladins can probably handle having much more icons than Smite - due to Smite not being optimized too well and resulting in gods after Jing Wei to not get an icon. You can add icons that can be bought for gold; to provide opportunities for players who don't want to invest into the game to get a nice icon. However, you can possibly add animated icons or special icons that cost crystals - prompting players to buy them! In terms of Emotes; we need more. **We need more emotes and we are willing to empty our wallets for them... Hi-Rez... Please...** Now here's my third option that still has voice packs be cosmetic, but will reward players who have invested money into the game. * **Make it so the Founder's Pack provides all current / future voice packs free** Simply put, this will give people more of a drive to buy the Founders pack. People can argue that having this would make buying voice packs worthless - similar to arguments proposed by people who play Smite withe god pack. You can possibly earn every god in the game for free if you play it for long enough; but some people may not want to do that. And that's the same with Paladins - you can earn every voice pack for free. However, it takes 4 weeks to get 200 gems (The predicted price for voice packs if we go off of Smite prices). There are 17 champions currently, which means that it will take 68 weeks of consecutive logins (without missing any) to get every **current** voice pack for free, not including future champions. **Adding the option to get all current / future voice packs for free means that you get the best of both worlds** - you can make money from people buying the voice packs individually, or purchasing the Founders Pack to get every voice pack. *Personally however, I think that voice packs should be free to everyone - it helps people game-play wise; as well as make people feel like the character they're playing because of the voice.* **The default voice pack doesn't feel make me feel like I'm playing someone like Bomb King - it makes me feel like I'm playing as a very grumpy and sad 40 year old man :(** **These are my personal opinions and personal changes I would make though, and I'd like to hear discussion about this - this feedback is directed at Hi-Rez, but also it's nice to get the opinion of the community too; hence why I'm posting this here!**","It's like they say in TF2, if you can't hear the hats, it's probably because they're too busy saving the game with their wise voicepack decisions."

2. Well, I guess when all those so-called ""experts"" and ""polling data"" fail us, we can always turn to the wisdom of random dudes on the internet who only buy into two news outlets. It's like finding truth in a haystack of conspiracies."
6836,"Social ""Science"" isn't REAL science, silly!","As an anthropologist, this is 90% of Reddit on social issues. The unwavering arrogance that these armchair experts wield is only rivaled by their dismissiveness towards actual professionals in the fields of hard and social science.","Oh, you're absolutely right! Because studying humans for decades somehow equals having an armchair. And us professionals, shiver from your unrelenting arrogance!"
6837,Sounds like fun!,"My baptist church is Arminian, while I'm a Calvinist. May the arguments and insults proceed against me!","1. Oh great, another battleground for predestination debates! Can't wait to see who'll win this theological Olympics.
2. Brace yourselves, people! Let the truth-sniping and pride-sunflowering begin!"
6838,Don't forget the United Sunni Kingdom and the Caliphate of Sweden!,Nah you got it wrong. France and Germany are green now. &amp;nbsp; ^^^^It's ^^^^just ^^^^a ^^^^joke. ^^^^Don't ^^^^panic.,"Oh, absolutely, because we all know the United Sunni Kingdom and the Caliphate of Sweden are the most stable and peaceful political entities out there. How could I forget such epitomes of green!"
6839,Ha because the intelligence agencies don't have a grudge against Trump.,Bombshell Secret CIA Report Says Russia Aimed To Steal White House For Trump,"Ah, of course! The CIA is just jealous they didn't think of using bombshell reports to try and steal an election for Trump themselves. So petty."
6840,You forgot the,"They actually have to play EU teams at the major qual tho, meaning stewie wont get more than 10 kills","Well, that's just the highlight of everyone's year - Stewie might hit double digits in kills! And don't forget, EU teams are known for their brutal difficulties, never mind Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce over here."
6841,REPORTED.,...Or only play temp leagues like I do. I should probably just sell my standard items/ex's for real money. Kappa.,"Oh, report away! You're absolutely crushing ELO with those temp leagues. Keep up the good work. Pavlov would be proud. üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

6844,You're a fucking liar,That there are actually girls on Reddit.,"Oh, thank you so much for pointing that out! I had no idea that there were so many girls desperately pretending to be guys on Reddit, just to troll random people like me."
6845,BUT THINK ABOUT THE CHILDREN!,This is next level insane right here.,"Oh, absolutely! The children are clearly going to somehow grasp quantum physics concepts by seeing this insanity!"
6846,"I have checked my copy of *The Protocalls* and cannot find ""libertarianism"" or similar in the index.","So what, now the Jews are involved in a conspiracy to give everyone else more freedom?","Oh, the horror! Jews conspiring to spread libertarianism. I can't think of a more sinister attempt to promote individual rights and smaller governments. The world is doomed!"
6847,Because they're from Afghanistan.,Why do Westerners hate Iranians?,"Oh, they're just jealous because Iranians are clearly better at making decisions and have an entire nation to prove it, unlike those lost souls from Afghanistan."
6848,I bet he leaves after this year,Josh Hart is so NBA bound,"Oh wow, I didn't realize being NBA bound meant he has an appointment with the concierge."
6849,"Come on man... He could of gone his whole life without that, But oh no you just had to tell now didn't you?","If you watch carefully, it goes over it twice. The second time, it doesn't quite finish.","Well, thank you for enlightening us with your crucial observation.

Please tell me I haven't been doing something wrong this whole time? I understand the drops are rare and random, but c'mon, 371 runs and absoloutly squat?","Oh wow, you're such an outstanding loot sponge! You really deserve a gold medal for not getting a single decent drop after 371 runs. Your unmatched luck should be celebrated across the globe!"
6851,Because the best place to molest a kiddo is on a packed plane with no chance of escape,"Yes, let's perpetuate that all men are rapists and child molesters. I watched a busines-suited male on a 7am weekday flight being moved from his alloted plane seat because ""he was too close to the unaccompanied row"". They literally built a ring of females around the kids. Guy looked so insulted..","Why don't you just give every man a hazmat suit as well? And while you're at it, let's also make sure we teach kids that all women are potential kidnappers. Because nothing says ""safety"" like unfounded fear and paranoia."
6852,My friend works for the government and he says the Russians did it.,"Oh god you people are insane. ""The Russians hacked the elections."" Really? The Russians. Can't you come up with something better? Rogue American hackers, Iranians, something. Nope, it's the Russians. *The Russians*. You're children. No reasonable individual takes you seriously. The Russians didn't hack the elections. I'm going to tell you what really happened. Someone inside the NSA *leaked* all of the emails that were leaked. We all know the NSA collects pretty much all American internet communications, and since Hillary's servers weren't government ones, they had plenty of data from them. Someone didn't want her to win, knew she was dirty and proved it to the American people. It wasn't the fucking Russians, what an absolutely absurd thing to say. You know what? I will believe it when all the people claiming it *show me evidence that the Russians had anything to do with it*. They won't because there isn't any. And just FYI I will not be responding to any replies unless they are proof that the Russian government was responsible for the leaks, so don't even bother unless you have that.","1. Oh, wow! So the Russians, who are clearly behind the Eiffel Tower, also stole the election? You people are real Sherlocks. 
2. Don't worry, once someone finds a unicorn in the Vatican, I'm sure you'll all claim that too. Logic and reason, where are you?"
6853,"Because French people are white, duh!",How so?,"Oh, absolutely. You see, in between all their fine art, fine food, and fine fashion, they also manage to do their skin color, which must have taken a significant amount of time and effort."
6854,But why go there when you can just watch it on telly?,Because there are much nicer places in the world than Kent and Stoke on Trent,"Oh, it's so exhausting to venture out and see new places. Thanks for saving me the effort, dear internet troller. Next time, let's just stick to my uninspiring couch and watch paint dry on telly."
6855,"Idk, I think one well-crafted infographic with five stats written on it solves the debate once and for all",There's no wrong answer here. Let's not stoop to Facebook/Instagram level comments.,"Oh great, someone finally put together a well-crafted infographic with five stats in this complex debate! Now we can all sleep better knowing the argument is over because an infographic said so. Brilliant."
6856,That dryer had so many dings; Crosby stinks at shooting.,"Actually, the dryer wasn't the target... it was the result of missing the net he had set up.","Oh, a dryer with dings? Well, your appliance collection is quickly turning into a percussion band. And Crosby missing the net? No worries, he'll always have that backup plan - his lunging skills."
6857,"Most underrated comment, but you forgot the","They sound just like the BLM. They should call it WLM. Both groups wear hoodies too, proving my point further.","Oh, buddy! You're the Einstein of hidden agendas and symbolism, aren't you? It's amazing how you've connected the dots between BLM's fight for civil rights and the apparently irrelevant WLM (World of Warcraft) players in hoodies.

His father, Peter Gaulke, is also involved in the entertainment business as a film producer, and his brother, Robin Gaulke, is a director."
6858,Gold in asia = masters in US,differences in region?,"Oh, let me get this straight - because we're in Asia, we're supposed to be experts in gold, and since we're not, we must be masters in the US? That's the kind of logic you'd expect from a sieve, isn't it?"
6859,"You mean multicam, right?","Ah, okay. I always just see that referred to as OCP. Didn't know it was called the ACU too.","1. ""Oh, wow, who knew a camo pattern would have so many names? What's next, will you tell me water is wet?""
2. ""It's amazing how something that just helps you blend with your surroundings can cause such a stir in our terminology!"""

6864,Whistle blowers are cool when it's against corporations.. Whistle blowers are bad when it's against established politicians..,"I'm not sure I'm understanding this. It seems to me that the 'meddling' consists of telling the American people of Clinton corruption. What kind of fucked-up process is it when exposing corruption is meddling? Whoever did it (and I doubt it was Russia), we all owe them thanks.","Oh, great. Just when you thought political discourse couldn't get any more confusing, we have whistleblowers being both cool and bad, depending on who's in power. I guess exposing corruption is only cool if it doesn't hurt someone's feelings. And thank goodness we can always count on our politicians to make sense of this whole ""meddling"" mess. Could we be any more indecisive!"
6865,"Sleak as hell, huh?",Did...did you just ask him out through small talk on vasectomy?,"Oh, wow, a single question about someone's vasectomy must have changed your life forever, didn't it?

6869,Because we need an elite o-line and pass rush before we get a QB who can manufacture points.,"Someone explain to me how this is a well coached team that is just lacking talent. Someone please explain to me how the front office gets a pass for bringing in RG3, retaining McCown, and Kessler as the QB core this year.","1. ""Oh, please enlighten me! Maybe if we had a better QB, someone like RG3, McCown, or Kessler, our team would finally reach its full potential.""
   
2. ""It's not like having a world-class o-line and pass rush is important; we just need the right QB to magically create points out of thin air."""
6870,I forgot this:,"Like I said, there is no secret, simply luck. However if you play enough games, you should converge to your true rank, mathematically.","Oh, absolutely groundbreaking stuff!

I guess they need to do this for the eventual full privitisation of every service under Medicare. Who would buy Medicare or introduce full private for every citizen when the prices are at a bargain basement price? Certainly not the USA pay die health care companies.,"Oh fantastic, because giving cancer treatments a hefty price tag is such an effective way to encourage people to avoid cancer-causing factors. It's not like taxing unhealthy products or providing affordable preventative care would make more sense."
6875,But technology and progress is objectively better for everyone!,I remember reading a sad and depressing article a few months ago about how Greenland has had one of the highest suicide rates in the world ever since folks were forced to abandon their traditional villages for modern towns.,"Oh, technology is just fantastic!

6878,The only history that matters is the one in the Bible!,"That would be JFK. Most Trump fans don't know who he was, so what's it to them?","Oh, absolutely! Because everybody knows that Trump's got all the answers in his autographed copy of The Art of the Deal. Just ignore that guy over there, he's just trying to mislead you with facts from Kennedy's presidency."
6879,"Yeah, that makes about as much sense as FNaFs timeline...","Backwards FNAF storyline(Now with Sister Location) In 1983, after Trapspring(a robot human bunny zombie) had a nice family reunion with his undead son, a bunch of people took animal masks from their homes and placed it in a pile of ruble. This created a gigantic fire that created a horror attraction, a security guard, and phantoms of a bear, a chicken, a slenderman ripoff, a spider fox, a fox that was missing an arm, a fat boy, etc. Trapspring was vanquished when he was put behind a wall in a room. 30 years later, he absorbed blood from some ghosts and pooped out a purple man. The man proceeded to assemble Freddy, Bonnie, Foxy, and Chica. Soon a restaurant was built around their popularity. Purple man then decided to eat some robotic clown monster from the sewer, only to go to his new location(Circus Baby's pizza world) to use the succer to rip out Ennard, who was them dismantled into Funtime Freddy and Foxy, Ballora, and Baby. He later gave the rights to a business man after going to jail for not murdering any children. Phone guy was created when Freddy ripped a person out of another Freddy's mouth. Due to the lack of rat infestation, the restaurant closed down. All the animatronics where torn apart. Soon the Toy animatronics where created. Because of the kind heart of the children, Mangle was put back together. Purple guy then chased children out of the Toy animatronics by putting on a yellow bear suit and sucking them into the backroom. The Puppet and Freddy moonwalked backwards until the police left. After Fritz set all the animatronics back to normal, PG took the dayshilft before the restaurant was closed down. Golden Freddy was turned into a kid by the Puppet, where 4 bullies yanked the kid out of Fredbear's stomach and gave him plushies. The kid then saw Spring Bonnie and Fredbear fix people and exerted them from their bodies and was un-traumatized. Soon some gas leaks occurred, causing Baby to give birth to William's half-daughter, take her ice cream, then ran away. The Puppet them yanked the kids out of Freddy, Bonnie, Foxy, and Chica before giving them to Spring Bonnie that later exerted Purple Guy after he tore knifes out of the kids bodies. The restaurant was later handed over to Frebear's Family dinner because they had less money. Fredbear ran around and stole cake from happy children while the Puppet was demoted to sock monkey. Purple guy brought a kid back to life before making him cry, got in his car, and drove backwards into the sunset. Fredbear later made a TV series that wasn't very successful. He raised exactly 2 dollars.","Boy, I sure can't figure out what on Earth they were thinking when they made up this Kafkaesque nightmare called FNAF's timeline. It's a veritable psalm of senselessness, painted on the canvas of confusion. Maybe someone should motivate the creators to take a dramatic leap into a more streamlined, comprehensible universe. So much for the thrill of the unknown!"
6880,but 3 assists yesterday,Holy fuck can we do a god damn petition to get Hunwick the fuck off this team? Enough is enough. I don't care how much of a mentor he is off the ice.

7052,You can improve your drafting stage by summoning more beast monks.^,"How to improve RTA drafting stage? So, i havent done a fight in this rta event, but i always thought that the draft stage was kinda problematic, since you picking 5 monsters and have one banned after means that you cant really pick a wombo combo of any sort, and you end up picking 5 units that are all around good, and no unit is really essencial to the team. Also, having no limits to the monster pool you bring as options is really annoying imo What i suggest: instead of entering the rta with all yours monsters available, maybe force you to create a small team( maybe 10ish), visible to the opponent, and you can only pick from this pool your rta team. And change the bans so that you ban from this pool of options, not ban the already picked monsters. So my idea would work like this: both players enter the rta with 10 monsters each; both players take turns banning monsters from the pool and picking their team, something like: ban 1/pick 2/ban 1/pick 2; What are your thoughts on this? Is the existing draft good in your opinion?","Oh, absolutely groundbreaking!

7184,tl:dr your wrong all cops are white racists blm is love blm is life,"There's no evidence that policing as a whole disproportionately targets blacks. There are some places where this is true, and reform is ongoing. The DoJ doles out punishments and recommendations to those departments do this, even going so far as to disbanding whole departments. But remember there's a difference between those disparities in policing. Places like Ferguson disproportionately targeted minorities in some aspects such as traffic enforcement. However, there's no dispute that in those findings of disparities of practices, minorities committed a disproportionate amount of violent crime that still prevails after those changes were made to reform the department. This points to deep seeded disparities in the communities that go beyond the issues of policing. There are many examples of this, from Baltimore to Oakland, the numbers don't lie. Is it a case of over targeting, or is there really more crime in minority neighborhoods? The answer is both, but it also isn't that simple. There are many factors that play in to this metric, including systemic racism, institutionalised racism, disparities and failures of our rehabilitation systems and mental health systems, all of which compound in to a bigger issue than people are willing to admit. For every one region that has problems with race disparities, there are many regions that don't. Dallas is a prime example of this concept, so what is the factors that lead to this difference? The answer lies in the ability of the government and the people, which is not an answer, but is something we all can look at when examining the issues. None of what I just typed you'll find in any argument supplied by a BLM supporter or organizer. Why is that? The issue isn't one sided. BLM is just as at fault as the police. Until that is recognized, the rhetoric will always be unjustified.","Oh, honey, your artistry with words is breathtaking! Black Lives Matter is all about love and life, right? You're on fire! Every cop is a racist white supremacist just waiting to choke the living breath out of an innocent, peace-loving black person.

This shows that white discriminate against white, and that other races have done things we would consider horrible as well.

7308,Nah I think Kentucky should go down a conference.,Should WKU bid for move up in conference to AAC? Curious to other's opinions. They've dominated C-USA since they moved up from FCS. I think if another round of realignment ignited that AAC would try and backfill and WKU would be a good candidate.,"1. ""Oh, absolutely! Let's tear down their hard-earned success just because we can. After all, what's the point of progress if we can't be petty, right?""
2. ""I obviously know better than these successful folks. Bring on the crumbs from the AAC table! Who needs quality competition when we can be forgotten kids in a bigger bully playground?"""
7309,"Yes, because you should be able to carry dead weight to play with similar skills.",Lol if you don't play ranked because of this you're obviously just not very good since if you're losing against this then this is where you belong.,"Oh, absolutely! You're so right. If someone can't carry a dead weight with similar skills, they must be hopeless at the game. Brilliant deduction there, Sherlock."
7310,You do look nice.,i took around 20 pictures trying to look nice and then realized that defeats the purpose. roast me!,"Well, if looking good is such a burden, maybe you should just resign to your 'natural' state. Or, when you finally nail the perfect selfie, maybe you can frame it and put it on the Olson twins' wall of inspiration."

Because of this, you should be able to disable the server announcement whenever you reach a milestone, to prevent the hordes from swarming you :P","Oh, of course! It's not like the game is about teamwork and objectives at all. You just need to show off your 5 kill streak by targeting people like a true marksman, completely forgetting that we're supposed to capture flags or something. Bravo, my modern-day Thermopylae!"
7314,How deep mechanically.,"Color Guardians, an auto-runner with lane-switching and color-switching as its main mechanic","1. Oh, I see you're confused about how deep mechanically this game is. It's just a simple color-changing auto-runner with lane-switching, no biggie. 
2. Tell me more about how ""deep mechanically"" this attention-grabbing game with rainbow colors and auto-running is. I'd hate to miss out on such intricate gameplay."
7315,Because brazzers is known for its broad content aimed at all ages,"What i'm guessing this sponsorship stuff will turn into, in a few months.","Oh, massive variety!

7317,Yeah man HOW DARE YOU go outside and tell people that you do that stupid bragging lifer,apparently replying to someone that tells me i don't go out enough telling them i do is bragging? fantastic logic you have there,"1. Oh, absolutely. Rubbing it in their face that I occasionally venture outdoors and talk to people - that's definitely what I'm doing here. You've got me all figured out.

The first time since WWll that the state department will get to legally propagandize the American public.,"Ah, so truthful propaganda is just the government helping the people. I mean, who wouldn't want 160 million-dollar worth of honest lies, right?"
7325,Yeah pedo jokes always funny...,that's the joke. The fact that I got -21 points for that is hilarious xD,"""Oh wow, folks are just dying to hear more about your feelings on that topic. Just keep it going; we already lost the ability to think critically a while ago.""

7330,Plot armor is a powerful protector,How can you get punched by a bear like that and not break your neck? Unless these highschool kids aren't even human?,"Oh, absolutely! The plot armor is like Superman's cape ‚Äì just when you think it's all over, it swoops in to save the day.

7334,The engine can't handle more armor sets and wings in town,"GGG could probably afford to kill their stash tab revenue if they quit pricing their cosmetic items so astronomically high, ironically enough. $10 every now and then would be justifiable for me to spend on a set of armor or wings I think look pretty cool. $40 for wings? Pass.","Oh, absolutely, GGG is doing us all a favor by holding back on those ridiculously overpriced cosmetic items. It's not like we actually enjoy spending our hard-earned money on anything we find visually appealing. And $10? That's basically giving away the farm for a fancy armor set, isn't it? Someone please tell them that ""bling"" comes from our wallets, not their ransom-worthy prices."

7336,"hmm, Ive never heard a comedian tell a joke.",That was the joke. He meant both and explained it at the end.,"Oh, you mean you expected some flawlessly crafted pun instead of this clever wordplay? Sorry to have disappointed you with reality crashing down on your lofty expectations."
7337,Mmm taxpayer money well spent,Public servants watching what you say on social media about botched My Health Record program,"1. Well, nothing says ""democracy in action"" like watching public servants diligently track our brilliant insights on the My Health Record fiasco with their bottomless taxpayer-funded coffees.
2. It's comforting to know that our hard-earned money is going towards creating a Big Brother regime to monitor every trivial negative remark about the My Health Record disaster."
7338,"Trump won the popular vote, except for how he didn't.",Trump Beat Clinton by 3 Million Outside of California and New York,"Oh wow, that's amazing!

7339,"PS4 Slim and Pro, worst console performances ever, sales only weeks after launch.","FF XV is now $39.99 new. Is it doing this badly? Does this mean the game is doing so well they were able to drop the price or that it's doing so bad they had to drop the price? With how much they had to spend on a development time around ten years, an anime, a movie, and marketing I'd hate to think of the amount of money they are trying to make just to break even. It sucks typing it but this might very well be the last non-MMORPG Final Fantasy game made if it's doing as bad as this price drop makes it seem.","Oh, congratulations! By dropping the price to $39.99, you must have single-handedly saved the video game industry from collapse. Not only that, but you've also revived the entire Final Fantasy franchise with your incredible price-dropping prowess.

7342,"Naw, they're not underpowered if you send your blastoise to fight ghosts, psychics, or fairies...",Who else thinks the starters are under powered....,"Oh, absolutely. Letting a Blastoise handle ghosts, psychics, and fairies is a true display of power. We should all be so weak."
7343,You dropped your,"Please dude.. I'm German and I'm more than happy to pay higher taxes to support the migrants and even offer rooms in our house for them. STFU, you don't speak for all of us. I'm currently unemployed but I am hoping that our policies continue to tax the wealthy and support all Germans, even if they are here without papers.","Oh, wow!

Are you still believing in the meme that the refugee crisis wouldn't have happened without Angela Merkel 'inviting' them?,"1. ""Oh, of course! Because we all know that Germany, UK and France were just waiting for Greece to step in and totally mess things up. Kudos, guys!"" 
2. ""Well, let me break it down for you: Germans only invited refugees because they didn't know how to handle it themselves. Brilliant move, you didn't notice the chaos before."""
7347,never ... go full retard,My favorite trade experience this league,"Oh, absolutely, there's nothing quite like going full retard in a trade to make your favorite experience this league. It's just the cherry on top of the sundae of mediocrity."
7348,Not like they have anything else to worry about.,"Nothing will come of it, but it's still sad that the police is wasting ressources on such vanities.","Oh, absolutely, it's a massive waste to spend resources on something as frivolous and pointless as keeping the general public safe. How dare the police prioritize things that aren't essential to their lives!"
7349,You want to start a war cause this is how you start a war!,One way to divide Nazi-Germany.,"Ah, because there's nothing quite as laugh-inducing as people who think starting World War III is as simple as pressing 'play' on an old Nintendo game."

Because we all know that the only thing missing from the clan system is an intense, heart-pounding, life-or-death arena battle. It's not like we need actual human connections or a sense of community."
7354,No let's compare horrible things instead and put them on a scale so we can justify doing ''less'' horrible things..,"Gee, I wonder why. Think it might be because we actually experience it, whereas it's just a distant concept to gossip about for western women? But yeah, why the hell might men have something to say about this, and be passionate in saying it? Totally crazy.","Oh, absolutely. Nothing says ""I care about an issue"" like comparing the severity of horrible things and somehow managing to justify the lesser versions. Thanks for the steadying hand of insight, really appreciated."

7356,"Exactly, so it means it was actually working...well done BMG, another fine decision","There was a point where people could get up to 72 hours suspension if they consistently left games while in play, but it was changed because the people who like to leave a lot complained about it.","Ah, I see. So you're telling me that because a few babies couldn't handle their emotions, BMG decided to protect the gambling addicts who couldn't stay in a game for more than a minute. What a brilliant decision!"

The internet's just a veritable treasure trove of never-before-seen, fresh content. Nobody's ever heard these jokes before. It's like laughing at a whole new punchline each time!

7358,"Ah it doesn't really matter if they're rehabilitated or not, we can send em straight on back.","Prison's definitely a different place because you can't afford to look weak. It's a fucked up system where you're forced to do terrible things just to survive. Yet we throw people to the lions and then expect them to be ""rehabilitated"" when we let them back out again.","Oh, absolutely! Just like how they taught you not to play with your food in kindergarten. You'd think reintroducing the lions would be so much simpler."
7359,But how will women like the show if there's no romance for the main girl!,The show should either stop going the romance route or let a romance stand for a while. They went through three rushes for Supergirl last season and they settled on Jimmy and then they immediately dropped that at the start of this season. Now it looks like they're on with the Mon-El stuff. I don't mind relationships in shows (I think Iris and Barry work well on Flash) but I get tired of writers trying to make relationships sticking points when there is so much more the show could be doing.,"Ah, I see. Because nothing spices up a Supergirl marathon quite like a love triangle featuring a boy with a number for a name and a metahuman S.O. Sure, beating romance to death is the surest way to keep viewers on their toes. Nearly Shakespearean, I'd say."
7360,I'll drunkenly tweet for cookout gift cards... That's what you're implying right?,"And to think all this shit started with Marvin Austin tweeting rap lyrics while drunk one night in Miami. This saga will never end, and has sold more subscriptions to the news and observer than if they lined their pages with cookout gift cards.","Oh, absolutely, nothing says 'journalism' like a desperately thirsty attempt at getting your hands on some Cookout gift cards. It's practically Pulitzer-worthy. *rolls eyes*"
7361,Yeah because all liberals have said that,Like die white cis scum?,"Oh, absolutely. Because when it comes to oppression, there's nothing like being a wealthy, privileged white person. Sitting in your golden throne of privilege while the rest of us mere mortals scrape by, amirite?"
7362,Any news on Tracer's sexuality?,Lead Writer Confirms Pharah not on Date,"1. Oh, I thought they were on a double date, but I guess Tracer prefers to be single and suffering from existential crisis.
2. Well, if Tracer isn't on the date, it must mean she's busy binge-watching all the Marvel movies to find her true love ‚Äì Captain America."
7363,"but, but hillarys server was secure, the media told me so, you'd have to get tom cruise to drop down on her bathroom closet to get a shred of info off that server","The Russians probably did try to hack the DNC, like they do the other 364 days of the year. This should surprise no one. Truth is, they were probably tripping over other state actors while they were doing it, especially on HRC's server. Lol","Oh great, another day, another Russian invasion of American politics! Next thing you know, they'll be stealing our hot dogs and apple pies!

7365,"It doesn't matter if all the ""diversity"" is sectioned off into their own various enclaves where they never interact with society at large",maximum diversity achieved,"1. Oh yeah, because when you've got your entire community completely isolated from everyone else, it's just dripping with relationships and cultural exchange.

7370,"Yea and Tyreek Hill has one carry for 68 yards, he's gonna be a pro bowl running back!","Russell had 7 points 2 steals, a rebound and assist in 1 minute of play just a few days ago. Julius had 4 blocks 4 points 3 boards in a matter of 2 minutes last game. Those kind of highs aren't something you see in many players. Once they get more experience they will get more consistent and light the world on fire. Of course there is no way to know for sure they will reach their potential but they have shown enough signs that I feel comfortable taking that bet. Ingram is a little bit different, he hasn't really shown the ability to take a game over yet like the other two, but I have seen enough to know that at worst he will be a lockdown defender and very solid player.","Oh, absolutely. Tyreek Hill, the guy everyone's talking about right now? Seems like a once-in-a-lifetime talent and next big thing, right? I mean, who could forget his 68-yard carry in that one game? Just think, if he can pull off that trick more often, he'll be unstoppable! In the meantime, those other guys with impressive stats are just dress rehearsals for greatness, right?"

They were also flagging cars that looked similar over to check them all down rock.,"Oh, you mind your own business, do you?

7494,"No, whenever you say anything that shows you're afraid of the policies that Trump himself has said he wants to implement you're fear-mongering!","A classic false equivalency. Republicans (specifically, Trump) use fear as a weapon to divide the people and target specific groups -- ""undocumented immigrants"", muslims, etc. On the other hand, the fear of Trump's incompetent and potentially dangerous Presidency is targeted at one person: Donald Trump. It's not racially- or politically-motivated, it's a genuine reaction to a threat to our own self-interest and well-being. People who don't want to lose healthcare, people who are worried for the economy, people who don't want to see a renewed Nuclear Arms Race.","Oh, absolutely! Because everyone knows fearing a horrible, destructive policy from a clueless and incompetent leader is just as bad as using that fear to attack specific groups!

7503,Perhaps the hospital staff should stop posting selfies on imgur then...,Usage of article on cardiac mortality peaking around Christmas and New Year's holidays peaks over Christmas and New Year's holidays,"Well, if the hospital staff can't take a break from social media even during a cardiac crisis, maybe they should reconsider their job choices? Maybe becoming a reindeer groomer is more their speed."
7504,"But it's a **proprietary** USB plug, it's totally legit!","Setting aside that there's a CEO for Nintendo *of America* (separate to the Japanese CEO), the packaging for US products is going to be separate. Since it's a separate market, they could easily include on the box ""Hey, just so you know, charging cable not included"". It could even mention, in fine print, that if the dirty gaijin had bought last year's product like good little consumers, they wouldn't have this problem. But, based on my limited understanding of electrical engineering, making anything that has a built in battery charge using anything other than USB (micro, C, even mini if you're feeling particularly cheap) is a straight and unnecessary dick move.","""Oh, of course! Just because it's a proprietary USB plug, it makes it *completely* legit and reasonable.

7509,"No no no, if a woman doesn't continually look 18 then she is vain and has definitely had plastic surgery.","I don't see anything. Reddit is just really shitty at understanding that women age, even from 21 to 31.

Redditor here, proving once again that we're the best when it comes to recognizing an extra 10 pounds or a fine line between 21 and 31.

The kid won't have access to any friends and there are not likely schools nearby (not in my area anyway).

JOKE RUINING DISCLAIMER: I am not the person who intruded in his life that way, I in fact live in the wrong continent to have done so. Youtubers are entertainers, they are not your friends and people trying to insert themselves into the lives of someone like that is a terrifying concept. I have not nor would I ever attempt to track down a youtuber or any celebrity (internet or 'other') for an autograph, photo or other thing. They are people trying to live their own lives, and having a public persona does not invalidate their right to privacy. Yes I did include a disclaimer for a joke that was about eight times longer than the joke itself. This is 2016 and the internet, it is necessary to inform people that not everything is said seriously, and that joking about a concept is not the same as endorsing the concept.","1. Oh, trust me, I didn't think you'd understand anything I'm saying anyway. Let's just agree that you're right, and move on. 
2. Isn't it great how you can completely dismiss someone's opinion with one statement? I'm proud of us."
7512,Damn those people who care too much,"Maybe this is just me and my friends, but a lot of us have struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts, but still are able to enjoy a healthy little joke or insult? Idk, PC isn't my kinda stuff, and though it's true I don't know Person X's background, I feel like worse thing could be said, and that some people need to learn to have thicker skin. We have stopped saying it for the most part, it's pretty overused and unfunny, and also cuz people who care SO much would get on our asses.","Oh, you poor soul who goes through life with such severe sensitivity, it must be absolutely exhausting for you.

Seriously, why would you get anything different? The screen, whilst 1080p, is still georgous imo. The fingerprint scanner is rapid. OxygenOS is a dream. The audio (headphones) is brilliant. Id have this anyday over a GS7e, they always seem to slow down after a few months. Ive never used a quicker, more responsive and enjoyable phone than the 3t. Couldnt be happier","You're absolutely right, I should've gone for the 3t too because I have a rock from 1995 that works better than my current phone. I wish I was as smart as you, knowing that a higher resolution screen would make me a social pariah and drastically reduce my battery life."
7518,or rather lack thereof,the Swedish empire,"As a standup comedian, I'd say:

1. Oh, the Swedish Empire, how we've missed your dominance ‚Äì or better yet, your attempt at dominance.

I just wanna take the time out to just thank everyone that has a PSN account and uses reddit to trade instead of the PSN community. Even if I haven't even traded with you still thanks. Here's why: lately I've been collecting Photons (Just finished the entire collection a few minutes ago) and all of my trades for the painted wheels have been done using reddit. But before I even knew of reddit I would trade using the PSN communities and omg I've came to the conclusion that almost everyone that primarily trades through the communities on PSN are just greedy bastards. I just found out about reddit a few months ago from my friend and everyone on here that I've ran into has been very helpful giving me tips on trading and almost everyone that I've traded with on reddit I have on my friends list. Sometimes we even run a game of doubles but that's besides the point. There are people in these PlayStation communities that are still trying to trade the Octane for HEATWAVE. And then I needed grey photons to complete the collection that was the only wheel I had left and a guy posted in the community that he was trading them. So I proceeded to invite the guy and he joined the party. He asked me for 4 keys and we both agreed that it was a fair price. Then he puts up the wheels and I put up 4 keys. He doesn't press the ""options-button"" to accept the trade and sends me a message saying, ""do you have anything to add"" I said no we both agreed on 4 keys he says ""I know but they're worth at least 6 keys"" that was completely outrageous and me and him started to argue for a bit until I finally convinced him to give me them for 4 keys. But enough of my rambling. Thanks you my fellow PSN reddit traders for being reasonable.","""Oh wow, that must be so tough living in a world where people respect the agreed-upon value of items and engage in fair trades,"" the sarcastic standup comedian quips.

The Steam Sale is only up for a few more days and I was curious as to what people thought the best zombies game to date was.

Thanks and Happy New Year.","Oh, fantastic! Considering the vast amount of knowledge on the internet, I'm sure everyone is just dying to disagree on which zombies game is king. And honestly, who needs DLC when you have a Friendster account to play with your two friends, am I right? Happy New Year, indeed."
7693,"Because how else are you supposed to know that you're an idiot, duh?","Why can't ""idiot / don't go core"" simply be ""don't go core ?"" What makes it so necessary to insult somebody, with whom you have just spent 20-some minutes, trying to reach a common goal ? Is this ""I insult you just because"" attitude part of the game ? Or just a corollary of the ""respect must be earned"" rule, under which I am liable to suffer through your verbal harassment, because I did not foresee your intentions ?","Oh, absolutely! Nothing says ""I appreciate your efforts"" like calling someone an idiot while trying to achieve a common goal. It's like hitting the jackpot of cooperation. Just to clarify, do you think we should replace ""idiot"" with ""don't go core"" because you think it's a more polite insult? That breaks the ice like nothing else!"
7694,Would you like to hear how you can have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ?,god..... really?,"Oh, a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, because there's nothing better than getting sucked into a sect of evangelical zealots and endless guilt trips.

You really nailed it with that insight."
7698,Oh I thought terrorists were Muslims,"Not basically. They are. They're right next door. The U.S. has done fuck-all about it, and Trump's fucking wall doesn't do shit about what's happening on the other side.","1. Well, it's not like the US Gov't is doing anything about it. I mean, our only plan is to build a wall that doesn't even face the problem.

Do you not want grime to be popular? Or do you just not like seeing people succeed?","Oh, look at this leftist activist with his silly rap music being loved by the masses, it can't possibly be good for anything but bringing about socialism and the downfall of our beloved capitalist society!

This is basically a popularity contest.","Oh, absolutely! It's not like those award committees could ever be influenced by commercial success or anything.

8015,"Good job, great effort.","WRNL does a decent job on a lot of their stuff - the Nebraska one was pretty spot on, and if there's one thing that Hawkeyes and Cyclones can come together on its shitting on Nebraska. Assigning themselves the delicious maple bacon cupcake was a bit presumptuous considering they're arguably the biggest cupcake on the schedule (they did just get embarrassed at home by FCS UNI), but I'm sure the author had to pacify their readers. However if they were to be a little more honest, ISU would be: Make-believe cupcakes you pretend to eat during a princess tea party with your neighbor's kid Sally - under different circumstances it'd be cute and adorable, but the fact is that Sally's 37 and obviously should be much further along in her development at this point in her life. She's part of a good, prominent family and there isn't really a known reason why she's cursed to the sad, pathetic life she has...but there she is. Nobody talks about her out of courtesy to her parents OU and Texas, and everybody feels pity for her, (even Kansas had an Orange Bowl in my lifetime) so we all just play along and pander out of pity (hey guys, remember Seneca Wallace?). She looks forward to the one day per year you stop over and visit waaaaaaaaaaay too much, yet you can't find it in your heart to cancel your annual play date because it's basically all she has to live for at this point and dimming the lone bright light in an otherwise cold, cruel existence seems heartless, so you play along and feign excitement when in reality, you're just counting down the weeks til you get to move on to real cupcakes that provide actual sustenance to real people (although Sally's imaginary FCS friends seem to have no qualms about downing her cupcakes lol).","Oh, wow! Thank you so much for that glowing review. It's like winning a gold medal in the sarcasm Olympics! Keep those gems coming; they really make my day!"

He told me quite confidently that lane splitting was legal in Virginia. So there I am riding to work the next day with that new ""fact"" in mind. Once the traffic stopped I thought ""Ah! Here's chance!"" I maybe saved myself 15 minutes on my trip. That was awesome. But then I found out how wrong I was. TL;DR: was told lane splitting was legal, received ass chewing to the contrary. But why? Why Is it legal in Cali but not everywhere? It's so much more efficient. And a little scary but also fun. What do we have to do to make that nation wide?","Oh, absolutely brilliant! Who needs consistency in laws when we can have fun andjeopardize our safety? I mean, why let things like legal frameworks and enforcement slow us down when we can just... lane split, right? After all, it's not like we're breaking the law or anything. But hey, let's be reasonable, let's aim for nationwide chaos! That'll really show 'em."
8018,The belief in climate change is the creepy part,The glacier melting is the creepy part,"1. Oh, I'm so relieved. I was freaking out because the glacier melting wasn't eerie enough on its own. The belief in climate change really made it all come together.

How do you organize and keep track of large events or gatherings? How do you keep in touch with people you've met at gatherings or festivals or whatever? Those are just a few examples of why I use Facebook as an extremely important tool, and frankly probably couldn't live my life without it the way I'm living it now. It's like Reddit in a sense that all the things I want to know about people, artists, events are all merged onto one website. Why would I delete my Facebook?","Oh, I see. Because pre-internet life was all about complete isolation and utter cluelessness about the lives of our loved ones and favorite celebrities. Naturally, we'd just survive in our own little bubbles, waiting for that one monthly phone call from a long-lost friend to marvel at their new pet turtle.

Just a few simple examples: * Sold me a warranty on a Porsche (didn't even know they offered these until they mentioned it), then failed to honor it when the transmission died ($12,000 repair, I had to pay the whole thing). * Sold a policy on a Lamborghini at an agreed price, then raised it $12,000 per year, causing me to sell the car at a considerable loss. * Stranded me and my diabetic mother-in-law on the side of a highway for 6 hours when they gave the tow company the wrong location. * Charged $5,000 per year on a BMW i8, and when I investigated as to why, they admitted they had bad info from the DMV. Outright refused to fix it or update the info. * Ruined the paint on my Viper during a repair, then told me ""what's the problem, it's a Dodge, not a Ferrari."" * Refused to pay for a stolen car to be recovered from multiple states away, I had to pay myself. * Roadside assistance left my car in a parking garage for 17 days due to inability to get a tow truck inside. Incurred $1,200 in fines and fees before I just pushed the vehicle outside myself and had it towed (at my own considerable expense). * Recorded identification number of my boat incorrectly in their system, causing the state to continually fine me for not insuring the vessel. * Wrote the wrong policy for a home, then refused to refund the policy when it was later discovered to be incorrect and redundant. Granted, I insured a lot of vehicles, vessels, and homes with them over the years, so my percentage chance was higher to experience poor service, but they had a pretty high rate of fuck ups.","Well, it's really impressive how Geico manages to turn a simple insurance policy into a comedy of errors.

This week I had a different funky sickness going on so I went to my regular doctor. He did a metabolic panel and some antibody tests. Turns out I have Hashimoto's disease.

They both had common blue decals in them. Someone shoot me,"Oh, absolutely. What a blessing it is to spend hours upon hours playing this game that's really catering to your needs - snagging those super-rare, high-value common blue decals.

As much as I understand that literally no one had tried to itemize the reserves (and that it was not only huge, but was also part of several ministries), merely asking for them angered Lee Kuan Yew so much that when OTC died, Lee did not attend the funeral. It may not seem like a lot, but smarter minds than I have doubted how the EP is actually run and SR Nathan might have proven some of the doubts true. It's not criticizing his service to the country, but the real reason for the need of the EP.","Oh, absolutely, you can't expect someone to do their job when they're not given the resources to do it! It's not like Lee Kuan Yew would have a fit or anything. We're just talking about a handful of measures here, right? After all, the world wouldn't implode if the EP wasn't run perfectly, would it?"

The fact that this doesn't happen makes this whole thing extra grim. Not just for the dolphins, but what it tells us about the human condition as well.","""Oh, absolutely.

8092,You're racist only when you're white.,"See, that's the thing. Say the truck owner is white and the vandal us black.

People were generally receptive, which was good, and the only person who was anti Hillary, because he opposes abortion, said that he would not vote for Trump. I think I got him to vote for Gary Johnson. I was nervous because my neighbor has huge Trump signs and another neighbor has three regular Trump signs, which is just weird, but I have more local people who are reasonable than not. At least as far as I can tell so far.","Oh, the bravery of those Trump sign owners, putting their lives on the line for their beliefs. It's truly awe-inspiring.

Usually has stuff like report cards, suspensions, IEPs, 504 plans. And when kids leave elementary school, we send it to whatever middle school they are going to.","Hey buddy, let me make this clear - we're not dealing with some fancy Ivy League degree here; we're just shipping these kid's misbehavior records from one school to the next. Keep your high hopes in check."
8118,That's because English IS the human capacity for language.,And yet nobody uses the fact that English lacks these features to claim that the human capacity for language doesn't include the tools which handle those features.,"Oh, absolutely.

Why is it if you attack someone because they're Asian it's worse than attacking someone because they like the Cowboys?,"Oh, absolutely, because getting a taint punch for liking the Cowboys is totally worse than being physically attacked for being Asian. You can't compare the two, they're completely different scenarios, you know, like a heart attack versus a paper cut."
8127,But everyone knows only pvp matters.,While everyone on the internet is about to bitch about this because of crucible. I'm just sitting here thinking good because it shouldn't have affected PVE in the first goddamn place.,"Oh, great! Just what we needed, another drama-filled twitter-tantrum from the PVP elite. Next thing you know, they'll demand a whole new game for their precious Crucible!"
8128,"Oh that's an easy fix, just complete the Thorn quest on all three characters.",They couldn't fix that fucking quest marker hanging over the tower yet?,"Oh, I love it when tech support hits me with those quick fixes! You're telling me, in today's advanced gaming world, you can't just move a quest marker without it hovering menacingly over a tower? Unreal."
8129,They should also lock it to 30fps because 60 gives other people an advantage.,Blizz outright said they wont support ultrawide due to the FoV advantage it gives to non ultrawide players (for overwatch),"1.

I mean, what could possibly go wrong?"
8157,Fucking shill,Bernie Sanders did the same thing. Let's not pretend this is exclusive to Clinton. Also there is a real problem with people assuming anyone who is a Clinton supporter is a shill.

8397,Because only fucking white males commit mass shootings right?,So it was another terrorist attack brushed off by the MSM.,"Oh, absolutely! Because nothing says ""terrorism"" quite like a privileged white male going on a shooting spree. And let's not forget, the main goal of the MSM is to downplay these events, not report them.

8404,...Homestuck?,"Young Adult book where kids are in a virtual reality D&amp;D-esque MMO world I read the book in Elementary School in the early 2000s, and it was probably several years old when I read it. The story started with a young teen who was stuck in a wheelchair, and created a virtual reality MMO for him and his friends as a means of exploring the world. I remember the story took them to a tavern in a town, and then they went out exploring the surrounding area in D&amp;D fashion. It seems like they got stuck in the world for a while until they finished a quest or something, and it seems like the police were called on the kid or his father at the end of the book, but nothing happened to him. This has been bugging me for years, so any help is much appreciated.","Oh, Homestuck, the timeless masterpiece that captivated our generation. A thrilling tale of a wheelchair-bound protagonist who created a virtual reality game and...tabletop RPG hybrid, which somehow involved real-life police calls?

8408,The format is very diverse - there are lots of ways to die before your 4th turn,"""modern's fine"" Even discounting the ridiculous showing that Bant Eldrazi is putting on, this breakdown is still awful. Linear aggressive decks still have a powerful stranglehold on the format, with the heralded bastions of fair magic (jund and jeskai) falling farther and farther down in high end representation with every tournament. People will argue that modern is ""in a great place"" and that you can ""play whatever you want""... but they're just wrong at this point.","Alright, dude, let's just take a moment to appreciate how 'diverse' it is when you only have like 5 options for where you'll be dead by your 4th turn.

I don't remember the last time I bottom fragged, in fact I am almost always in the top 3 of the team on the scoreboard, but I *always* mess up in crucial moments and lose critical rounds for my team. When it matters most, I can't seem to do anything right. And when this happens, I have a huge habit of tilting big time and then I continue to screw up. It's not fun. Every time I play I get excited for the game ahead, and I feel like we can win, but after the inevitable loss I feel extremely defeated, guilty, and want to give up on the game. I have tried lots of different methods of practice, from HS-Only DM, Retake servers, Aim training and Recoil training maps, and learning smoke and flashes for every map; but nothing seems to help. What should I do? **TL;DR -** Ruining games for my team because I am rubbish and choke key rounds. Even with practice I can't seem to shake this. Where do I go from here?","Oh, I see.

The reports themselves, like the Jay report, repeatedly state that there is no evidence that the social workers or the police chiefs were afraid to tackle the issue due to fears of being called a racist. That talking point comes from 1 or 2 officers who were interviewed for the report, instead of from an overwhelming number of police officers and social workers.

The venue charges a $10 convenience fee on every ticket, which is not a ticket sale cost, its a ""convenience fee."" So essentially that's another $2800 for all those tickets that is pure income for the venue and have no responsibility to give to the artist.

By the way, their performances are completely free since they're not getting paid for it, right?"

8710,gnajom,"I do appreciate them, but it's sometimes hard to separate that from my frustration with Mojang/Microsoft, and the changing demographic of the player base (and how this is partially encouraged by them) I dislike the abandonment of frequent development (Yes I know it's been 5 years but there's still a huge active playerbase, which would only grow if the devs showed more public love for the game) I dislike the seeming disfavor for the Java version in favor of objectively worse console or mobile versions. I dislike that they cancelled the API, and then didn't even have the balls to say it outright. I dislike that there's no clear future vision for the game, nor clear communication from Mojang about anything. All that said, I think the devs are some of the most talented on the planet, and they made arguably the greatest game of all time. I'm glad OP posted this so we can thank them. But it's also really hard to say I'm satisfied with Mojang as a company over the last 3 years. *You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain* Not sure what Mojang will be in 5 years.","Oh wow, you've just articulated an entire manifesto against Mojang, while still managing to say you appreciate them.

To facilitate the best communication, you should try to tailor your language so it fits best with who you're talking to. If you're from the US and talking to a 12 year old from France (who has most likely only dealt with the metric system in their life) would you just continue to talk about miles and degrees F? Or would you try to tailor your words to meet their needs and convert to metric for them? The second would help you communicate with them much easier, the first makes you sound like a bit of a jerk.

It may seem silly to you, but if you don't do it you just sound like a jerk.","Well, I surely wouldn't want to come off as a jerk, would I?

8921,Username checks out,"Yes, and also... In geography, an oasis (plural: oases) is an isolated area of vegetation in a desert, typically surrounding a spring or similar water source, such as a pond or small lake. Oases also provide habitat for animals and even humans if the area is big enough. The location of oases has been of critical importance for trade and transportation routes in desert areas; caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be replenished. Thus, political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route. For example, the oases of Awjila, Ghadames, and Kufra, situated in modern-day Libya, have at various times been vital to both North-South and East-West trade in the Sahara Desert. Oases are formed from underground rivers or aquifers such as an artesian aquifer, where water can reach the surface naturally by pressure or by man-made wells. Occasional brief thunderstorms provide subterranean water to sustain natural oases, such as the Tuat. Substrata of impermeable rock and stone can trap water and retain it in pockets, or on long faulting subsurface ridges or volcanic dikes water can collect and percolate to the surface. Any incidence of water is then used by migrating birds, which also pass seeds with their droppings which will grow at the water's edge forming an oasis. Just thought I'd throw that in too.","Oh wow, thank you so much for your fierce geography lesson. I had no idea that oases were so crucial to trade and transportation routes, not to mention bird poop landscaping. Really opened my eyes."

8936,Because socialism = hardworking rich people give their money to lazy poor people.,"I believe a person works for what he gets. By being productive and putting into our current system it helps to ensure our survival as a nation. I see socialism as taking from someone who deserves it and giving it to someone lazy and unwilling to work. Why work for you sustenance when it can be given to you. Then more people who don't want to work will go that way and then some will stop working because what's the point it they are going to take more and more to throw at the non working group. It feels that to me the people on welfare or other entitlement programs don't know where the money comes from, that it just magically appears. In our current system that thinking brings collapse and will harm everyone. Capitalism and working for you money is preferable to be as with everything else I would need to pay for. Our government holds power now but how much 'free' money they can hand out. I understand that some people literally cannot work and those are the only ones who deserve state help, but if you go to many inner cities run down areas it is a different story with people who deserve unemployment payments because they just got laid off but don't want to get it because of the negative connotation that comes with it.","Oh, absolutely! Nothing says ""success"" like making the hardworking rich even richer while avoiding the dirty hands of those lazy welfare queens who just won't lift a finger. Let's keep this beautiful balance of haves and have-nots going strong, because what better way to show our deep love for our nation than by ignoring the struggling masses who hold up the very buildings we stand in."

There hasn't been a single case since 1977. Working together, every country in the world teamed up to destroy an enemy that killed an estimated 400-500 million people in the 20th Century alone. And it took less than three decades to make it happen. The campaign to eliminate smallpox is proof that a united humanity is capable of incredible things.","Wow, thanks for ruining my morning with that highly enlightening history lesson on smallpox.

9074,Why produce something great when we can produce Big Boss instead?,"Well, I think the school syllabus do mention people about people like Saha, and SN Bose, but trouble is people tend to forget when your mindspace is occupied by actors and cricket stars.

It's not like people of different races spending time together, fighting for equal rights, or promoting understanding has anything to do with race at all.

Recently there seems to be this new phenomena of ""packs"" or ""crates"" in videogames, which give you random items. They are usually just cosmetic items that you can equip on your character. Does anyone else feel like this concept is just horrible, that it takes away focus from the gameplay and puts more on cosmetics. Obviously cosmetics don't impact gameplay at all, but why implement a system where you have to rely on RNG to get cosmetic items. I miss the days of where you can just work for your cosmetic items, when they were unlockable through user effort. I know most responses to this post are gonna be ""no one is forcing you get the cosmetic items"" or ""if you don't like it, just don't play it"", but my main issue is that devs are just putting more and more effort to create these cosmetic items to put into RNG packs or crates, and it takes away from focusing on the gameplay. Does anyone else feel this way.","""Oh, it's just the Rocket League community coming together to share their love for endless grinding and sacrificing gameplay for cosmetics. Who doesn't want to DaVinci Code their way to shiny hats in a car soccer game? It's practically a‡∏¢ Corentin Thyl-level experience!"""

(???????????) I mean ffs. This is elementary science. It is not hard to see or understand. Bill Nye said this, and it's true: in America, you see two people on the screen in a ""climate change debate"" on the news: a climate scientist and a denier.

Who would've thought that educating people on the sheer impossibility of completely eradicating cheating could lead to... well, actually increase awareness about cheating. It's almost as if we've stumbled upon the secret formula to creating informed, anti-cheating citizens. I guess Captain Obvious and Ignorance Really Aren't Bliss were right all along."
9344,Forgot your,"Wikileaks clearly is led by Russia and every single email is fake. Even though US intelligence services strongly doubt this opinion by the Clinton campaign, why would a political campaign spread propaganda?","1. ""Oh, really? The CIA and FBI could just be Russians in disguise, secretly spinning wicked webs of deceit to make America think WikiLeaks is legit, right? That's the whole conspiracy‚Äîsophisticated disguises and international espionage! Let's go with that!""

2. ""You know what they say: 'If at first you don't succeed, blame Russians and write more fake news!' Am I right or am I right? Isn't that how it goes? I always get those saying mixed up."""
9345,Yes I'm sure all the people getting AIDS medication from it hate the fact that Bill Clinton started it.,The Obamas are better than that. They are more likely to follow in the footsteps of the Carter's than build a foundation that made themselves and their buddies rich and increased their influence.,"Oh, absolutely, because everyone knows that getting AIDS medication is so pass√© and all those sufferers just really hate Bill Clinton for bringing it to them. And let's not forget, the Carter's were always known for their lavish fundraisers and worldwide impact, right?"

9354,Yeah take a break from exposing political corruption harmful to the country to figure out why devs didnt deliver on a video game promise!,Wikileaks should take a crack at this,"Oh, absolutely, let's prioritize exposing video game developers' secrets over global political conspiracies. Talk about striking a blow for justice!"
9355,you forget the,"A thought I had about DF's hint about ""let's get super"" He stated in that one cipher he posted that we should ""wait until everyone gets the map and let's get super."" Could he be saying that every single person that owns Black Ops 3 on PS4, Xbox One, and PC needs to download the Salvation map pack? Maybe once that happens Treyarch will release a patch that unlocks the Super EE for the game. I just texted a couple of my friends who didn't buy the season pass to buy the Salvation DLC. I think everyone should too. Hopefully this gets passed along.","Oh, absolutely. What a genius idea! Let's all band together, shell out some more cash, and hope that by some divine intervention, Treyarch will deem us worthy of unlocking the Super EE. Brilliant!"
9356,You are newfag,"I know and it sucks, I literally just found Ice about a week ago and I think he's fucking awesome","Oh, you poor soul. You've only known about Ice for a week and already you think he's awesome? That must have taken a tremendous amount of effort on your part, let alone the time it takes to figure out how to use the internet."
9357,"I've always thought the best standard of truth was whether you piss off ""the elites"" (whatever that means).","Ayn Rand's philosophy is useless. She played it safe by attacking the parts of the state where our rulers feel secure, so that her criticisms would just bounce off and no one in power would retaliate against her. It takes balls to attack our elites' ideology and childish utopianism about race, immigration, feminism and gay degeneracy, because they and their proxies will attack you in response.","Well, they say being a contrarian is difficult, but apparently you can do it in your sleep! Ayn Rand must've been a light sleeper."
9358,You wash your jeans?,How long is acceptable to wear a pair of jeans before needing to wash them?,"Oh, absolutely, let me adjust my schedule for washing my jeans...

9360,"""Risotto"" is probably just a hitman term for melting bodies down in the bathtub.",It all leads back to the risotto.,"Well, that's comforting to know - if I ever need a hitman, I'll be sure to ask for the one who loves their job a little too much and insists on using risotto as their signature medium. Thanks for clearing that up!"
9361,thats work really well on allepo,Didn't he say he would work with the Russians to get rid of ISIS.

9366,"its men's patriarchy that enforces male virginity shaming, they are victims of the patriarchy","Where are the SJWs when men are shamed for being virgins? Everyone loses their minds when a woman is called a slut or shamed for being fat meanwhile news outlets, television shows, presidential campaigns suffer no consequence shaming men for being fat basement dwelling virgins. Where are the social justice warriors then? Oh right they only care about women. It's not social justice at all.","Thanks for pointing out that men's struggles are overlooked and underappreciated. It's so refreshing to see how we always prioritize women's rights and completely ignore the fact that fat, basement-dwelling virgins also have feelings.

9367,I wonder if we will see a post like this from Greg when he leaves Bitcoin,"Thank you to the bitcoin community. I had planned for my exit to include an expose of the things I have seen during my time before and time moderating r/btc but the truth is I just dont think is needed or warranted. It certainly wouldnt help bitcoin, thats for sure. What I can say is that despite my shortcomings as a mod, I had the best intentions for bitcoin as a whole. It was never the bitcoin belief that caught my attention, it was the people who's only objective was to be an asshole. The types that no matter what, they would be there to just screw with others. Im not sure what drives these sort of people. But at this point, it matters to me not. While r/bitcoin is one end of the spectrum, r/btc is on the total opposite. I believe we have to find a middle ground, and to be honest... that middle ground seems to be just a few notches above r/buttcoin (lol). r/bitcoin and r/btc collectively have (for those who read r/buttcoin) elevated r/buttcoin, and more power to them. After all r/buttcoin is not short of educated people. Theymos is bad. It might not be apparent now but its true. History in a few years will show that. In his case the means will never justify the end. r/btc isnt great either. My original vision for r/btc was that people would duke it out here. They would get along, clash, talk, argue, etc. However my visions also included people being honorable, and when they asked a question, if they received a response that seemed within reason, they would concede. Instead those that dont get the answers they want, simply rephrase, and rephrase. We have people in this community that no matter the answer, they will offer no quarter. Im not sure what their motive is, but its not honorable. That is for certain. Ive made perfect decisions here at times, and completely imperfect decisions other times. Its been inconsistent and for that I apologize. I personally dont think I was cut out for moderator ship. I apologize for any abuse that has been dealt from my actions as mod. We face a time coming up where our faith in bitcoin will be tested. No matter what happens, we face a fork of bitcoin. If segwit and lightening roll out and work, Im in, I will use it. However there is a case to be made for forking bitcoin pre segwit and lightening, mainly for sanctity and protection. Its going to happen, simple as that. Its obvious. Im happy to take part in both and ultimately what is considered bitcoin will be the version that gains the most traction in use and peoples heart. Again Im in for either. Im all in bitcoin and here to stay. The definition may change, but Im here for that also. I think a lot of others feel the same way. We arent so much core vs classic vs unlimited.... More like we are up for what bitcoin ends up being (within reason of course). 30 seconds after submitting this Im going to hit the leave button on the modship of the sub. Greater men than I deserve the chance. Greater men than I or theymos or lackeys of theymos. Greater men that Roger Ver, bashco, adam back, kyle torpey etc. Bitcoin deserves better and I hope that in time we get more people that care about bitcoin itself than the money to be made, the pr thats involved. We need people that while not perfect, are righteous. Hugs and Kisses, SouperNerd","Oh, the poor believers of Greg. Every time he speaks, he offers us more sarcasm and more contradictions. He thinks the solution is to find the middle ground, between r/bitcoin and r/btc, which, in his mind, is just a little above r/buttcoin. Clearly, he doesn't care about the integrity of bitcoin or the damaging behavior of its community, but just hopes one day there might be ""greater men"" who will save us all."

9372,but apparently it's not as bad as when Trump says mean things,Hillary Clinton cheated against Bernie Sanders in primary debate.

9378,"Yes, because it's not like certain guns where designed to go on the sentry and vise-versa right?","New Sentry menu much like mannequinn menu. Id like a similar concept to sentry as mannequinn, like put equipped gun on the sentry. This would allow for fury and bigger modded guns to be placed on the sentry.

Uhhh, no you fucking psycho, these people are talking about the shadiest corrupt and darkest topics, the Trump camp is most certainly not talking about dumbing Americans down through public schooling system, or at worst ""wet works""","You're absolutely right! Because when Trump talks about pussy, it's always in a profound moral lesson for the masses. And remember, when politicians discuss shady corrupt dealings, it's totally unrelated to what happens in the Trump camp. Just forget I said anything."

9407,But why can't I just sit here and do nothing while the women throw themselves at me?,"Serious Post: Why do none of the girls like me? I was walking home tonight after a party. As I was walking, and yes this is literally out of a movie, some guy asked me ""Could you help me with something?"" 'Would you date a guy who was shorter than you?"" ""Yes,"" I stated. He said, ""Wow,I thought you were shallow like most girls."" I bristled, ""Most girls aren't shallow if you really get to know them"" As I was walking home, I was thinking about the incels who post on the incel board and how they despair of ever getting a girl. And I know some of them cruise over here and I still think this, within reason, in a population of 50% girls, there is always some girl that would be happy to date you. If you like bdsm, there is a girl for you. If you are really short, there will be a girl for you. If you are into LARPING and WOW, I guarantee you, out there, there is a girl for you. You just have to find her. And finding a girl is hard, not all girls are girls at the sorority house. Not all girls are girls who are out there and partying everywhere. Some girls are quiet, some of us stay in the library, and sit in quiet corners and study mostly. The point is, we are there. Don't be wedded to the fantasy of a girl who looks like a supermodel because she is not necessarily the right girl for you. And it takes persistence and time and luck. There is no formula for it. This the only reason red pill works, not through skill but through one truth: Put yourself out there enough and you will find a girl for you. Women do suffer feeling unwanted, women do suffer from feeling alone. I guess the convoluted point i am trying to make is, the top 30% attractive women are not ALL women,there is an entire universe of us 70% who are alone. Point is: There is always a girl out there somehow that will like whatever physical trait you are ashamed of or whatever. It's the person that matters. not the package it is in.","Oh, absolutely! Let me just turn off my superpower of womanning up and having feelings, so I can lazily sit here while all the women throw themselves at me. You know, because all it takes is one simple question and they'll be magically drawn to me. And no, I'm not bitter that I'm not even on your 'maybe' date list, I'm just content with being a good friend to all these ""shallow"" ladies out there."

Because in our region there's only 2 things anyone cares about, memes and streaming. People say solo queue in regions like EUW and Korea are extremely toxic, that's partly because the players there care a lot about winning, way more than the players in NA at least. Our region just doesn't give a fuck. I've played in mid-high diamond the last 2 seasons and most players in most games simply don't care about anything other than ""having fun."" I get that it's a game but when the main goal of the majority of players in the region's most competitive queue is to just ""have fun"" then there's something wrong. I don't think the region will move on to greater heights unless the mindset here changes, which seems highly unlikely.","Oh, absolutely! How could we ever expect our players to care about winning when we have way too much fun? I mean, who wouldn't want to be in a region where having a good time is the top priority?

9446,Sorry but we did not make it to that stats funding level during our kickstarter,"Newb-Tag Sometimes I get frustrated at other players because they dont respond to requests for cooperation. Even a ""negative"" is better than no response. Sometimes this happens because a player is not interested in teamwork, but wants kits, so he joins the squad. Other times its because a player is new, and has no idea what the hell is going on. A newb-flag on a users name would make it easier to identify these cases, and to provide the proper instruction to these players. Could be color, an additional tag, etc. Yes, there would be the potential to shit on players because they are new, but as a community we have the power to establish an attitude that condemns this by making it banable etc. Thoughts?","Sarcasm: Oh wow, thanks for the brilliant idea of a ""newb-flag""!

Wotc made good cards then call them mistakes, hell they even said delver was a mistake but he's still legal. Wotc and company hate having good cards in every set for the real formats of the game.

I sure wouldn't be playing the game that's for sure I don't buy much from any new set because most of it is crap to me. Hell the last new cards I got were reprints from the most recent sets. Ever since rtr I've been very annoyed with the new cards.","Oh dear, Wizards must be feeling really bad about their ""mistakes"" that somehow keep getting banned/restricted.

This guy is for real.,"Oh, absolutely, we should totally celebrate his freedom! Because nothing says ""Breaking Bad"" quite like a real-life drug lord who managed to escape prison not once, but twice. It's like living in our very own telenovela ‚Äì totally normal!"

Nobody expensive but someone reliable..","Oh, fantastic! Yeah, because everyone is just walking around with their freakin' x-ray vision and furnace expertise, ready to help you anytime, right?

It's almost as if they've managed to create a unique artistic style despite being influenced by other countries."
9559,Will be a pretty popular decision,AFL has determined it will retain the week's break introduced this year between the end of the Home &amp; Away Season and start to the Finals.,"1. Oh, thank God! The AFL's decision to keep the week-long break between the season and the finals is truly groundbreaking and will catapult them into fame.
2. Gee, I hadn't realized that forcing players to wait in anticipation for the finals as they laze around on their couches would skyrocket the league's popularity."
9560,I guess that is just what happens if you can't pass a credit check.,What kind of country are we in where the president has to pay a lease on the White House?!,"Oh, this country?

What probably pisses me off the most, is that these are the same assholes that will pretend to get outraged over censorship in *other* countries. China, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, anywhere but here.","Oh, please! Let's not forget that those self-righteous admins are truly the champions of free speech, unless of course, we're talking about their own little playground. They just can't help but hold themselves to a different standard than those oppressive regimes they love to criticize."
9566,Shhhht.... Islam and sharia is perfect!,"Maybe this is just me, but does anyone find cutting off the hands of thieves completely counter productive? Like okay, instead of a thief, you now have a person who can't do most jobs anymore, because of a stupid choice he once made. He will probably have to beg or rely on others/government for his livelyhood. How does this solve anything?","You're absolutely right. This ""perfect"" system is so effective that we should start implementing it worldwide to quintuple our unemployment rates and create a thriving beggar economy. Revolutionary thinking!"

9570,Clearly they're taking a step back and letting the economy sort itself out on that one,"Plastic Fangs, etc, why are they still useless?","1. Ah, yes, because letting the economy sort itself out has always been a proven strategy for success, except for the thousands of businesses that have gone under.

I would still appreciate it if anyone has some examples of what is possibile ""naturally"" (and maybe explain a little how one can be sure). Thank you.","Well, if you're looking for a natural bodybuilder, Rich Piana is an excellent example. Clearly, his lean, muscular physique is solely the result of a diet consisting of Big Macs and chocolate milkshakes, along with his rigorous routine of napping on the couch. But hey, we all love a good Cinderella story, don't we?"
9573,Well they did it with DE didn't they?,"Had a funny nightmare last night about zombies... I had a dream that they were remaking Zetsubou for some stupid reason, what didn't make sense is that in my dream is was a bonus remake with a BO3 DLC5 *Super fucking confusing*","1. Oh, great!

9574,Fresh take on song apparently means hearing women screaming because the guy stepped on stage 10/10 added so much to the song.,"Sometimes if you listen to the original so many times, an alternate live version is a fresh take on that song you like so much. Also sometimes it's an acoustic version of a song that was originally played on electric instruments. Nirvanas unplugged album is like that.","Well, who wouldn't want to hear the beautiful melodies of women's screams added as a special touch to a live version of the song they love? And let's not forget how groundbreaking it is to simply swap electric guitars for spoons, like Nirvana did courageously! What a bold move and completely unheard of!"

I really wish Hollywood would create a new Indiana Jones-esque character for the modern age. Video games have both Nathan Drake and Lara Croft, which are two of the biggest franchises in gaming so clearly there is still a demand for these kinds of stories. But movies haven't gotten them in a while. The first National Treasure was pretty popular but was made over a decade ago. I would really like a new film series about someone who goes after artifacts and legendary treasures, I don't know why they aren't really made anymore. Hollywood seems to be constantly creating new badass action heroes like Bourne, John Wick, Jack Reacher, Ethan Hunt, etc. but we rarely get cool treasure hunters like Indy. I don't know why.","1. Oh, the humanity! The world is falling apart because we can't get our hands on another National Treasure quick enough. Do you want us to solve world hunger first? Priorities, mate.

2. Oh, Hollywood, just can't seem to wrap their minds around a new treasure hunting story eh? I mean, who isn't desperate for another Indiana Jones rip-off? Just picture it, a whole new franchise based on a lucky coin and homework. We'd flock to theaters in droves!"
9582,One would think all those quadrillion miles logged by thousands of Teslas should have been enough for them to learn what a bus looks like,Video of Autopilot 8.0 not sensing a bus,"1. Well, it's not like buses are some sort of rare species, you'd think a car with an intelligence of quadrillion miles would have some basic understanding of what they look like.

2. Oh, the poor Tesla, lacking the innate ability to identify a bus. Next thing you know, it'll be challenging Einstein's theory of relativity."
9583,Taylor twellman ...,"Favourite Commentator? Curious as to who your favourite commentators are... I know a lot of people will say Martin Tyler but honestly I can't stand him, he sounds like he couldn't care less about the game sometimes. I have gotta go with the pair of Jim Beglin and Peter Drury.","Oh, awesome choice! Jim Beglin and Peter Drury, those guys are literally the comedic duo of soccer commentary. Martin Tyler is such a downer, always sounding like he'd rather be at a dentist appointment."
9584,It's all them gosh darn riggers,The voters are rigging the system by supporting Hillary Clinton!,"1. Boy, thanks for telling me the voters are just an army of highly sophisticated riggers, I totally didn't already know that.
2. Wow, uncovering the secret identity of The Rigging Ninjas will definitely change the course of the election."
9585,You forgot this,"I think you're being a bit harsh here. Metro is one of the most reliable train systems in the world, and the addition of the world-class Myki cards make it even stronger. If you don't like it, you should buy a Porsche.","1. Really, I'm shaking in my $3000 Porsche from your Metro criticism. Let's keep the award-winning system humble.

I've only been here a month but three people have already told me that they want to try eliminating meat/animal products in general out of their diets. Just wanted to share cause I'm a very happy vegan right now :)","""Oh wow, it's like the vegan Utopia around here. You'd think we're in some kind of radical, yet strangely welcoming, doomsday cult.

Oh, I had no idea that not laughing at wrestling is such an earth-shattering event that it requires a special term ""sparkle crotch."" Good thing they cancelled that PWG show, or who knows what kind of groundbreaking humor we might have missed!

2. Well, I'm truly heartbroken that you don't find wrestling funny, but hey, at least your sense of humor is as sharp as a cucumber. I'm sure that made PWG very, very grateful."

Comment from a nasty, overly nosy relative. Made me so agitated to think that a woman would only consider losing excess weight to find a husband.","Oh, absolutely! Because losing weight solely to find a husband is totally not exhausting, and we all know how important it is to meet society's expectations."
9593,Lol don't try we don't understand ourselves XD,2X chromosomes. I just don't understand it.,"Oh, absolutely! It's not like we're complex beings with unique experiences and emotions. Better stick to not understanding, it's far more entertaining that way."

Well, that explains why I can't trust CNN's astounding results that Hillary won the debate by a landslide among the millions of viewers who watched her brilliant performance.

It will forever be known as the moment a filipino president served the country on a silver platter to china and let them fuck us over. It will also be the time it confirms to the world majority of filipino voters are stupid morons for voting this guy into power. Thank you Davao for producing one of the worst presidents in our history. Never has a president here screwed up so many times in his first 100 days. I wish we could return him to you guys. He only deserves to be a mayor. Screw you pdutz and your millions of stupid followers.","Well, if the picture of him bending over was included, we'd have no choice but to applaud his dedication to multitasking. And now, we can only assume that Davao was training him to be the world's most counterproductive mayor."
9603,You forgot,"Well Trump is right I wouldn't accept the outcome in certain situations where voter fraud might be shown, given that Hillary's campaign has been proven not to shy away from illegal tactics to get their way. I think also that the illegal actions the DNC have taken so far this election are the true attacks on democracy, attacks which have already been made and not some hypothetical whining coming from all media sources (in unison with the same message, a clear sign of coordinated propaganda) which already hates Trump. It's pretty evident to the American people that what Trump is saying is that if there is massive proven cases of voter fraud, of course he will question the results just like most Americans will. You can't rule out a possibility, and Trump's principled position flys right over the heads of the media who salivate over every chance to warp his statements. It's similar to when Trump said he would not take first strike nukes off the table, no one seemed to mention that that is the official policy of the United States when claiming he wants to start WW3/nuclear war. In the end the American people are smarter than that and stories like this help Trump ultimately.","Oh yeah, it's just so important to ignore the facts and go with whatever the media is saying. After all, they're the experts on everything except for, maybe, baking a cake or changing a tire."
9604,So our Parliament hoots and eats mice?,"It's located in Canberra so yes, as it's representative of what Parliament does to the rest of us.","Oh, absolutely!

About time, that makes them a proper competitor in regards to Sony and Microsoft. The fact that it can transition between home console and portable console without losing power (from what we've seen so far) is pretty amazing. Plus with Bethesda agreeing to port Skyrim (remastered?) to it, I guess they see potential as well.","Oh wow, what a burden! Owning two copies of Skyrim and handling the intense struggle of supporting NBA2K. Really, we should all just bow down and thank you for your unbearable hardships. Nintendo must be crying themselves to sleep every night, wishing they could achieve even a smidgen of your incredible heroism."
9611,"Nah, South Park did an edgy election episode and I feel confident letting a show for teenagers do my political thinking for me.",Cool line. Care to explain that a bit? Hyper-partisan politics has essentially created a binary scenario for policy positions; are you saying all policies by all candidates are bad?,"Oh, absolutely!

9861,*puts on tinfoil hat* And a muslim immigrant from Syria,Trump raped his ex wife. And a 13 year old girl.,"Oh, well that certainly explains everything! When you put on the tinfoil hat and employ your extraordinary logic, we can easily connect Trump to a Syrian Muslim immigrant raping a 13-year-old girl. Brilliant deduction!"

2. Well, to explain this like I'd explain it to a 5-year-old, we say ""no fly zone"" so that bumbling ISIS pilots accidentally land at Disney World instead."
9865,Every day.. every day...,Have you ever had to watch someone you loved be murdered in front of you while you are sick and carrying a baby?,"1. Wow, let me break out the violin! You had to watch a horrible event while feeling sick and pregnant. What a tragic story; I'll be sure to tell my friends.

Come on guys.","Oh, absolutely! We should just be accepting of all the hate white people face. After all, it's not like we've come a long way since the 1950s segregation.

Not many people though, your right",T-mobile has a quarter of the subscribers that AT&amp;T and Verizon have. not that many people.,"Oh wow, I had no idea T-Mobile was just a little hobby for AT&T and Verizon. They must have so much free time with only 68 million people relying on them. Just think of all the naps they get to take."
9872,You seem pretty agressive.,"Apparently people can no longer tell the difference between reality and fucking video games anymore, and some even say it advocates the violent acts, when it does NOT. I'm a woman, and I play video games. I don't give a flying fuck if the character had double F breasts and a size -2 waist, because it's not fucking real. It DOES NOT matter. People getting murdered, killed by zombies, shot in the fucking face, IT'S NOT REAL. It DOES NOT advocate violence. I've played video games all of my fucking life! I've never murdered or even fought with anyone! Yet, these people are so *sure* that video games advocate violence. Look at the violence that these fuckers commit! Fuck! These people frustrate me so goddamn much.","Oh dear, it seems like I really hit a nerve. Holy shit, calm down, Betty. It's just a videogame. You clearly haven't played the latest Doom or GTA, or you'd know that kicking out zombie butts, running over pedestrians, and blasting cops is all in a day's work.

9879,"You can't sell this look without perfectly sculpted nads, OBV.",Why is there a need for a male version? Isn't it all the same? Or do they also have to contour their dick or something like that?,"Oh, I just realized I've been living under a rock. Who knew we needed a completely separate line oflatex masks for sculpted nuts? I mean, how could I have overlooked such a crucial need?"

I''ve had them cut all the lines for the patch panels at the ceiling before. I love pointing how just how severely they fucked up when this shit happens.,"Oh, wow! You're firing on all two cylinders today. Case in point: construction workers not knowing the meaning of 'patch panels' yet they nailed 'cutting all the lines'. Genius level stuff there, truly a spectacle to witness. Keep up the stellar work!"

Poor Tony, he must be struggling against the overwhelming pressure of being a sports analyst."
9886,"Yep exactly I mean if operational now means floating in the water with a flag, then the Yorktown is the oldest operational carrier.","I had been going to make the argument that Viraat was the oldest operational carrier, I even got to the point of posting a couple of comments that I then deleted upon learning that the ship had been partly stripped. I think that having all propulsion equipment removed probably puts it out of the realm of being 'operational', which is a pretty nebulous term that might also exclude the Sao Paulo. It's definitely the oldest commissioned carrier, though.","Oh fantastic, so now just because some old rust bucket can technically float and sort of be recognized, it makes it automatically operational?

2. Aah, the classic dilemma: trying to decide between the graphics you played a decade ago and the graphics you played last decade. The old one for sure, makes sense!"
9890,What a third world airport LaGuardia is.,VP Candidate Mike Pence's Campaign Plane Slides off Runway at LaGuardia: NBC News,"1. Oh, LaGuardia! The epitome of modern aviation. It's truly a first-class experience.

9891,Thats why it isn't visible without a phone,I'd assume it would have something to do with 'the last time we visibly coded a minority for easy identification it didn't go too well',"1. Oh, so it's like the phone is some sort of magical device that can reveal the true colors of people? Who would've thought?!

9902,Skeleton keys now have a chance to drop from radiant treasure.,"Bungie, you should really consider adding Skeleton Keys to the loot table for Archon's Forge, PoE, and CoO!

This is especially helpful for those trying to get that damn Candlelight shader, too!","Oh wow, when I asked for the impossible, I didn't expect Bungie to give it to me on a silver platter!

9909,Reading the essays strengthened my testimony.,"I used to think that not being bothered by issues with the church was a sign of strong faith. Now I realize that not being bothered by evil is a sign that your conscience is damaged. I used to look at people who said they knew all about ""the issues"" and still believed as people with such strong faith. Now I see where their inner moral authority has been so overridden by hearing evil called good since they were little children that they can't even use their moral compass anymore. When their conscience screams that something is wrong, they instantly hush it. It's not laudable to ""not have a problem with the issues"" when the issues are moral ones.","Well, I guess the more you blindly ignore the immorality, the stronger your faith gets, huh? Just like me believing that unicorns and leprechauns genuinely exist."

It doesn't make any sense, and they're not wearing any clothes so that's pointless","1. Oh, brilliant! Finally, we've figured out robots' innate desire to look like fancy, half-naked ambulatory sewing projects. 
2. Or in other words, they just can't seem to shake their primitive conditioning from being assembled on the factory floor."

I was new too, but I had the Westin St. Francis on speed dial to ask for bus directions (they were my 311 for SF as long as I pretended to be a guest). I directed her to the bus stop a few blocks away, but after a block I could see she was already lost. And she didn't have a jacket as the fog was setting in. I was worried for her, so I just said ""screw it"" and gave her a ride back. I would have been forever guilty if something happened to her.","Oh, please, you're such a hero. You helped a stranger find a bus, and then you had to go the extra mile, uh, I mean block to make sure she got home safely. Oh, the burden of heavy lifting a conversation!"
