"My guess on why age is a bigger issue for Clinton over Trump is because she appears to be in very bad health and shape for her age.

"That's the biggest problem with these devices in general, 90% of how people use them is as a media consumption device.

Heracross just **eats fruit and sugary sap** so it's incredibly easy to afford food for it. it flies so it's easy to travel with too. other pokemon would need constant upkeep in real life I.E. a water pokemon in real life would need to be constantly close to a fresh clean water source at all times or even worse it might need salt water which is even harder to maintain. almost all fire pokemon are completely impractical because they have an open fire source on their body so you would never be allowed in a business or store of any kind. the thing is most pokemon are just too big, too explosive, and way too expensive to keep as a buddy or a pet in real life. this question comes up a lot on this subreddit and it's always interesting to see how many impossible pokemon are picked as a real life companion or pet.","I was honestly thinking about having an Electrode, so whenever I say hello it'll startle and explode",

IMO, the only nerf she needs is to make her steroid only go on cooldown after it is used up.

I'm raging at the frag-obsessed Soldier who can't figure out the point he's THREE FEET AWAY FROM needs to be stood on or we all lose anyways, so it's probably not a good time for him to rocket jump away because omg a demo, a scout and a pyro, too much let's bail. And most of all, I rage at the five idiots who REFUSE to push unless they're standing behind me as Heavy, but somehow NONE of them can manage to kill the spy that just waltzed past all of them to kill me, and their immediate reaction to my death is to run away rather than continue the fight.

They fucked up, yet you get to pay for it. An experienced team though or experienced players...? I think I got mad a grand total of once in my entire experience with comp TF2, and that was after an entire game of the enemy Engie CASUALLY running in for a kill on me while they ubered in on viaduct (no the engie didn't get uber), and somehow the entirety of my team wasn't grasping that ""hey maybe we don't have to turn our backs while retreating and maybe we should protect our Heavy while he doesn't have his gun out instead of just letting that Engie walk right in, kill him and then back off."" If you get dominated by an engie that's calmly gunning for you any time you don't have your gun out and you absolutely are NOT out of position or doing anything wrong, yeah, you'll get upset.

"Absolutely not. Fresh water fish, not safe raw, chicken extremely not safe raw no matter how ""fresh"" it is. Salt water tends to kill off the parasites that are found harmful to humans, and the ones it doesn't kill off are easily visible to the naked eye. This is not the case with fresh water fish, and especially not with land animals that cover themselves in their own feces. Salmonella can infect the entire bird without our knowledge, even the ovaries can become infected, which passes that onto the eggs. E. Coli can live in the intestines of chicken, and their feces gets trapped in their feathers, risk of infection is present even if you wash it because soap does not kill parasites. I don't care if this was the most delicious thing you ever ate, don't put that shit in your mouth. **Also, unless you know the source of that salmon sashimi is exclusively salt water, don't eat that either",I saw Bear Grills eat a raw trout before and he is still alive so that means I can eat all fresh water fish raw,
What happens then? People keep saying this like once they get federal funding it will change everything. $10m? That's one percent of what a campaign costs nowadays.

This could double as a buff for him. **Skye** - To keep with the assassin feel, make her disappear in a poof when killed. Good assassins never die, they just fade away. **Makoa** - Make him always fall on his back. He's a turtle, after all. **Cassie** - Similar to Mal'Damba, her bird can fly away towards her base. That's all I could come up with, but I'm sure that custom animations like these could ad a lot more character to the currently very bland champions.",what a waste of money for pros like me who never die,

"Don't be an asshole to the guy letting you into the bar So I work the door at a bar in my town on weekends. It's a pretty busy downtown area and on Saturday nights we check the ID of everyone that comes in, just to cover our own ass. So this 24 year old looking lady comes in and I ask her for her ID. She immediately goes on a tirade of ""do you know how old I am?!"" I explain that it doesn't matter and I have to check everyone's ID as that's our policy (along with the policy of almost every other bar in town.) so all her friends give me their IDs without any issue. Finally the angry one gets her ID out and touches it to my face and says ""see I'm fucking 30! And it's my birthday today!"" So I politely respond with ""that's nice. Maybe you should act like it."" And she loses her shit telling me how much of a dick I am. And I told her she didn't need to come into the bar if she didn't want to. And she told me she'd be where ever she wanted to be. And this is where she is drinking. So she goes to the bar and I tell all the bartenders to make her wait as long as possible before serving her and then to only serve her once and cut her off. She stood at the bar for 20 minutes or so before finally getting a chance to order. She orders one shot and then goes to order a drink, the bartender responds with a smile. ""I'm sorry mam we are going to have to stop serving you. You appear to be to drunk."" She freaks out and tells her friends they are leaving the bar. But the best part is all her friends were having a great time and didn't want to leave. So she ended up leaving by herself on her birthday. TL:DR. Don't Piss off the guys letting you into a bar. They have just as much say in whether you get drinks as the bartenders do.",It's called being a bouncer you stupid useless ogre!,

"What if instead of trolling... Dear Diehard Duterte Supporters: Here's a challenge: BE THE CHANGE!

Help that senior citizen to cross the street. Do not counter flow. Do not bribe if you get caught violating traffic rules. In short, do something positive everyday and be nice to everyone.

"Entitlement and cancerous response to D3 @ Blizzcon I was disappointed like anyone else at Blizzcon over Diablo. But you will never see me bitching and complaining about this to Blizzard. There's a difference between being disappointed and being angry. Blizzard doesn't owe us anything. Diablo is FAAAR from being their biggest cash grab. Even now they're releasing a patch with balance changes and added features (patch 2.4.3), and this is something they DON'T have to do. You have probably already spent hundreds of hours playing this game. You got your money's worth out of it basically.. If you have ideas for blizzard for the future of Diablo, then provide those ideas in a respectful, mature manner, instead of behaving like bratty, whiney kids. Blizzard has NO OBLIGATION to give you remastered D1 or D2... That was something that the community hyped themselves up for. Blizzard may be working on another Diablo game, but they'll do it at their own pace.. it's their game, they'll release it whenever they want. And you should be thankful that they are still working on it. I've been a fan of the game, but I have to admit that the D3 community is just garbage. If blizzard drops the franchise, I don't blame them, because this community is cancer.","But this game sucks, which I realized after 200 hours.",

"What do you hope to see in Ben Affleck's ""The Batman""? Let's all be honest. Ben Affleck's Batman was the best thing about the Batman vs Superman movie. His appearance was true to the comic, his detective work was perfect and his combat skills were excellent. We all hope to see his solo movie when it comes out in 2018. So far, we heard that Deathstroke is going to be a major character in the movie. It is unclear if he is the main antagonist or not but we can sure expect him to be the badass mercenary assassin he is. Here are the things I hope to see in the Batman movie: - The Riddler as the main antagonist because a darker and grittier Riddler who takes over Gotham, builds deadly deathtraps, etc. is the perfect foe for Batman as an intellectual archenemy by bringing out the true detective work in the Batman. He could also be the mastermind behind the story and maybe be the one to hire Deathstroke to kill Batman. - Flashbacks to Jason Todd because I want to see more of Batman's guilt to his regret of his biggest failure. And maybe set this up for a Red Hood movie. - More Joker. Jared Leto's Joker needs redemption because he only had like eight minutes of screen time. I want to see him as Batman true arch-nemesis. He could be the tertiary antagonist. We could also see him doing most of the dark stuff that haunt's Batman's memories such killing Jason Todd and paralyzing Barbara Gordon, then torturing Commissioner Gordon by trying to prove his point with his most infamous quote, ""All it takes is one bad day to drive the sanest man alive to lunacy."" Also maybe an origin story of the Joker would be interesting. - An Arkham Asylum set story. Now I don't want the entire film to be in just Arkham Asylum but the idea of having the badass Ben Affleck's Batman trapped in an Asylum with all his most dangerous enemies with all action is excellent. These are just the few things I want for the Batman solo movie. What do you hope to see in Ben Affleck's ""The Batman""?","For it to end up being titled ""The Goddamn Batman""",

"It would be lunacy for the Red Army to go on the offensive in 1941. Here's why: The army was recently enlarged, and there was a shortage of command staff at basically every level. Many officers were catapulted up the chain of command without enough time to get the hang of their existing rank. These drawbacks could only be resolved in one way, through holding exercises, but large scale exercises had not been held for some time. Polish resistance was nearly absent during the campaign in 1939, and the army was feverishly working to process the experience from the Winter War. The state of the tank forces was especially sad. The old models of tanks were worn out with catastrophically few spare parts available. The new tanks were a whole different set of problems. Not only have the manuals not been written yet for the T-34, KV, and T-40, they were scheduled to be completed late in the year. Meanwhile, the tanks were worth their weight in gold and hoarded instead of being run into the ground in training. On one hand, the crews weren't ready to fight, on the other hand the factories had no worn-out engines to analyze in order to make improvements. Not that it mattered much: the T-34 and KV were already old news, production was gearing up for the T-34M and KV-3. The KV-4 and KV-5 were to be built next year, and only then would the heavy tank of the Red Army finally decided on. Things were going even worse with the T-50, the replacement for the obsolete T-26 tank. The prototype was more or less in an acceptable state, but it was unclear where to build parts for the tank. The engine was also a sore spot. Same as with the T-34, there was no manual written for this tank, crews have not yet been trained. Tanks are my specialty, so I know mostly about those deficiencies in the pre-war Red Army, but I'm sure that the state of the navy and air force were comparable. There was absolutely no way an invasion could have taken place in 1941.",Sounds like me trying to build an army in Civilization,

"Why it's time to move on from Dom Capers. **TL;DR - There are two main reasons it's time to move on from Capers:** **1. His defensive scheme requires a level of experience and consistency that is unsustainable in today's NFL due to injuries and roster turnover.** **2. Dom's scheme has a clear, consistent pattern of immediate success followed by a significant fall off as opposing teams adjust.** So breaking it down slightly further: **His defensive scheme requires a level of experience and consistency that is unsustainable in today's NFL due to injuries and roster turnover.** Dom likes moving parts. He runs a large variety of formations and alignments, as well as basically every possible type of coverage and blitz combo. His DBs play man, zone, deep, shallow, blitz, etc. There's little consistency play to play, much less game to game, and it seriously stresses his players. The volume of information they need to be able to retain and process and then use on the field means that it takes a season or two for newer players to really play sound football within the scheme. This is compounded with rookies who are already trying to adjust to the speed of the game, and results in a lot of blown coverages and broken plays. This is a problem because it can't really be fixed as long as Dom runs this scheme. Today's NFL, due to the way the CBA is structured and the stricter emphasis on player safety, is always going to have a high degree of roster churn. The days of being able to build a group and then keep it together long term are over, at the very least for Green Bay. The sheer amount of money on the offensive side of the ball means that Green Bay can't afford to keep the defense together. **Dom's scheme has a clear, consistent pattern of immediate success followed by a significant fall off as opposing teams adjust.** I'm just going to let some stats do the talking for this one. Here's the teams Dom has either coached or been defensive coordinator for since 1995, with their defense ranks in each year. **Bolded years are years his teams placed in the top 10 in either category.** Carolina Panthers: * **1995 - 7th in yards, 8th in points** * **1996 - 10th in yards, 2nd in points** * 1997 - 15th in yards, 13th in points * 1998 - 30th in yards, 27th in points Jacksonville Jaguars: * **1999 - 4th in yards, 1st in points** * 2000 - 12th in yards, 16th in points Houston Texans: * 2002 - 16th in yards, 20th in points * 2003 - 31st in yards, 27th in points * 2004 - 23rd in yards, 15th in points * 2005 - 31st in yards, 32nd in points Miami Dolphins: * **2006 - 4th in yards, 5th in points** * 2007 - 23rd in yards, 30th in points Green Bay Packers: * **2009 - 2nd in yards, 7th in points** * **2010 - 5th in yards, 2nd in points** * 2011 - 32nd in yards, 19th in points * 2012 - 11th in yards, 11th in points * 2013 - 24th in yards, 21st in points * 2014 - 15th in yards, 13th in points * 2015 - 15th in yards, 12th in points * 2016 - 18th in yards, 27th in points Do you see the pattern yet? It's pretty tricky, but it's that Dom's defenses turn to shit after his first two years somewhere. He's never coached a top ten defense in yards or points after his first two seasons with a team. Why that is is up for interpretation, but my personal guess is that Dom's scheme is built largely around confusion and misdirection. This is super, super successful when he first arrives somewhere, because opponents aren't use to his defenses and don't know what to expect. After a few seasons though, they learn his tendencies and what to expect from his calls, and they start to see the pattern in the madness. Then all the confusion and misdirection just keeps players from being where they need to be when they need to be there. Regardless of why, Capers time with Green Bay needs to be up. There's a clear pattern of failure here and after 7.5 years it's time to stop expecting it to change.","Hey, maybe this post will be the one that gets him fired!",

My sister and her husband are experienced dive instructors, so before the dive they tell me to go down, they'll signal at a certain point, and we'll all shut off our lights... they said to not move too much and just adjust to the dark, then they'd start waving their arms... This was the second week of a 2 week dive vacation, and our first dive at night where it was just us, the previous week they had a few other friends there. It was also after I had smoked pot for the first time since we arrived... We reached the depth where they said it would be the best, and turned off our lights... before anyone moved I was already bordering on hallucinating, and kind of ""losing it"" the combination of sensory deprivation, lucid awareness of our complete exposure to nature and the cycle of life from all sides in the open ocean with drastically handicapped mobility and sensory abilities in that environment compared to basically everything around you....

You're confronted with your minute and helpless presence in a vast and powerful ocean that you have ZERO chance of surviving in without the gear strapped to your body and feeding you air, at the same time as you witness organisms helplessly tossed about and illuminated by reaction to your every movement. The piercing sound of air rushing in as your regulator opens on every draw, and the heavy resonating glubbing of your exhaled bubbles, and endless ebb and flow of sound overwhelming your already embarrassingly poorly equipped sense of hearing. Only with the most active movement of your limbs can you accurately keep track of where they are, otherwise between the dark, the sense of floating, your body and the ocean being essentially the same temperature, you can barely tell where limbs are or even if you still have them.... you don't know if you're right side up or upside down, or sideways... you can't see the surface or the bottom... just endless blackness on all sides with the infrequent bursts of light in the distance from other unknown activity in the water...","That sounds, you know, okay.",

"Pre-Thanksgiving tension and hurtful insults Long-time lurker here, but recent events have unfortunately inspired me to submit a post of my own. My mother has always been a real Nmom - everything is always a personal attack against her, no one pulls their own weight around the house, everyone in the family is out to get her, et cetera. My father is normally a huge enabler for her, but lately has been acting more like an Ndad and following behind my mother, which makes it difficult to confide in anyone except for my druggie sister who's constantly away from home. Not only is my mom extremely emotionally manipulative, but has massive amounts of self-importance and egotism; I distinctly remember a childhood argument with her when I was around six or seven, and she delivered the classic ""let me know when I'm right for once in my life"" line after I disagreed with something - I made the mistake of telling her ""okay"", and she bursts into a tangent of ""NO. I do EVERYTHING right!!"" There are many more instances I can freshly remember of her N tendencies, but one particular event today was what drove me to post here. My family always hosts Thanksgiving, which is a trip in of itself, but preparing the house is always a nightmare. My mother is deadset on believing that I am a slobbish, lazy idiot, and absolutely relishes whenever I don't get something done so that she can lay into me and fuel her massive head. After neglecting to clean the dishes or vacuum the floors a few times in my early adolescence I am fully aware of the consequences and have no intentions of disobeying her orders. Being the day before Thanksgiving I was ready to help her around the house in any way that she'd ask of me, but she seemed to be incredibly relaxed and only asked me to vacuum the lower level. After this my dad asked me to clean the bathrooms, but low and behold my mother had already cleaned them only a few days prior and they seemed perfectly spotless. From assessing the house everything seemed tidy and in great condition to begin cooking and setting tables (tasks usually reserved for the day of Thanksgiving), so I utilized the first day of Thanksgiving break off of school to read a book on my couch and ended up taking a four hour nap. I awoke to my parents engaging in a pretty malicious conversation from the other room; they were absolutely tearing into me and my sister. My mother told my dad that I had done nothing, in any capacity, to help her today, and that she doubted that I had even vacuumed the floor because she claimed to have seen cat hair (even though in previous conversation she had both acknowledged and thanked me for vacuuming, and she knows our cat sheds all over constantly). My dad then asked her if I had cleaned the bathrooms, to which she took great satisfaction in saying she was the one who had to do them, completely neglecting to mention that they were cleaned by her unprompted days prior and making me seem as though I couldn't be bothered to clean them myself. My father ""apologized"" to my mother that they had ""two bitches for daughters"" and conceded that they would just set up Thanksgiving themselves, as they seemed to have much delight in praising themselves for taking on the deeds. This kind of shit happens all the time, but today my father's hurtful words struck me hard. It's very typical of my Nmom to neglect to give me tasks, but then admonish me for ""not pulling my weight"" and gloat the fact that she does everything for the household when she insists upon doing many tasks herself. I understand that as a student in her household I have an obligation to keep my areas tidy, maintain good grades/honors, and do certain chores without specific prompting, but when she jumps on it as an opportunity to inflate her ego and make her seem like the goddess of everything right in the world, it can get old very quickly. To add insult to injury I tried to go NC with my father for the remainder of the evening (difficult to do and a poor idea when you're still living with them), but he did NOT like this and his attempt to ""start over"" with me escalated into one of the more heated arguments with him in my memory. I'm genuinely scared and dreading what may happen tomorrow on Thanksgiving; trying to stay out of their way will likely only lead to a repeat of today's events, but getting actively involved in their chores will lead to tension that I don't know if I'm ready to endure.",Oh what fun Narc-idays are.,

"Im hopeful, but scared, Bungie. Please pull through with SRL. The main problem that I seem to see from Bungie is that they are a lot of talk and no action (on the current game anyways). There is all this big talk of the live team and their amazing efforts to improve the longevity and events of the game. We got all hyped for Festival of the Lost to be something different, or BETTER than its predecessor. However, this turned out to be false. Really, in my mind, they didnt do... anything to this event. The quest was the same, not even rewarding the new masks, you only got 3 treasure boxes which were the same as last year except the new stuff and then they were locked behind a paywall. What was new? Two ghosts, a sparrow, and new masks? My point is, this makes me really, really scared for SRL, or the winter event. Im scared that we will have the same rewards and questlines as last year. Im scared that we will have the same two maps with maybe one extra. And Im scared that this extra content for people who dont like SRL will be just a ghost to get from crucible, or maybe even just a one mission quest, for whole event. Im scared that the micro transactions will be a repeat of FotL. Bungie, we love your game. I love your game, it is one of the best experiences I have had playing video games. Please, please, please pull through. Listen to us.

"Transphobic fear-mongering jerk somehow also belittles me because I don't have a child This comes from a very long FB thread, so I'm truncating it considerably. Basically, the argument is about the HB2 ""bathroom bill"" recently passed in North Carolina. Someone said that they were going to vote for Trump because they have an LGBT sister, and they were worried that Clinton's open-border policy would allow anti-LGBT Muslims to come in and kill their daughter. So to keep the LGBT community safe, they're voting Republican. This absolutely infuriated me. I responded. Now this other guy (first guy's friend) chimes in and asks me to specifically name who is discriminating against LGBT people. I mentioned the HB2 bill among other things. A long argument transpired where he repeatedly asked me if I wanted a grown man to come in a watch my daughter shower/pee/etc. I didn't answer that because it's a straw-man argument and continued to provide facts. Eventually, after he repeatedly asked me, I said: Me: So now that you have proven yourself to be a hateful unChristian asshole who calls people ""penis in a dress,"" I will excuse myself from the conversation because obviously you are too bigoted to understand human decency.

"PVPers - How do you choose a good sidearm? I'll confess to being something of an ignoramus on the topic of sidearms, but I am wanting to give them a fair shot (getting pretty sick of shotgunning). But, I'm having a few questions that I really don't know how to answer: - *Which archetype works best?* From what I can see in the database, there are 4 different impact classes (15, 12, 8, 6), and I recall having used an example of each of them at one time or another. But, I can't honestly say that I remember one feeling significantly better than another. I'm sure the damage numbers change some, but the playstyle doesn't really seem to. Pull out. Shoot as fast as you can. - *Which perks do you go for?* I'm not entirely convinced that the in-game stat bars on the weapons do a great job of communicating the effects (and effectiveness) of certain perks, but they're really all we have to go on. My first instinct is to look for the same things I'd look for on a hand cannon: Hammer Forged, Rangefinder, HCR, etc. But, when you get something like Hammer Forged, the displayed difference on the range bar is so tiny that it's almost unnoticeable. Do sidearms not benefit much from range? Or is this just a bad system that does a poor job of communicating perk changes? - *What primary would you pair it with?* Obviously the intuitive thing would be to cover a longer range than what the sidearm is capable of covering, but how much is that? From my experience, sidearms can compete pretty well at ""mid-range"" (against fusions, hand cannons, etc), so that would lead me to think that a scout would be the best pairing. But, other than Mida, scouts seem pretty lackluster in Crucible in general. Am I missing something here? Thanks in advance for any advice!",Highlight them and hold square to dismantle.,

"I am not a pharmacist but a certified national pharmacy tech working as a lead technician. From experience I know that excessive use of diphenhydramine can cause side effects.

As an 'every now and then' sleep aid, if it works for you, then sure, BUT, if you do start needing to use it more often or every night or for consecutive nights please see your doctor to discuss other alternative. Some could be benzos which honestly is like a bandaid and isn't really a great solution to sleep problems. PERSONALLY (as a last resort if nothing else works) seroquel knocks me out when i really need to sleep, but the next day you will still be drowsy. Ambien is the best bet.

Okay fine, but they add the tip in the illegible paper tape math from a 1980s era cash register, and still leave a blank ""tip"" line in the credit card printout!

"Why CXP made me quit. I'm that guy who has been playing since day 1, with all 8 stories completed multiple times, 100% on operations, 40'000 achievement points, and over 500 days playing time. Even my oldest child, who was a baby when I started playing, is now playing with me. A lot has changed in my life, so where I used to play a TON, my playtime now is limited to somewhere in the range of 6-8 hours a week. About three months ago, I joined a raid team that was still progressing on HM revan, and since they were cool people, I didn't mind slogging through it with them even though I've cleared it on multiple characters, both in 3.0 and 4.0. Nearing the end of 4.0, we were making really good progress, getting further each week, but this CXP system has changed everything. Now, just to get back to a point where I can continue playing content I've already cleared at a couple different levels, I'd have to spend months or even years grinding and grinding to get back to a relevant level of gear. Where I used to be able to switch characters on a whim so as best to help out my team, I'm now limited to focusing only on a single character so as not to fall further behind.

She will soon be formally charged. It's also unlikely that De Lima was legitimately elected to the Senate; the 2013 and 2016 senate elections have been compromised but the investigations have been stuck in the mud for a while.

"I am a bit disappointed that Apex of Sacrifice is not a part of the Atlas First of all, don't get me wrong GGG that this is some kind of a rage. I really admire you and your team for the latest content which is making this game greater than it has already been. On the other hand, I don't understand why the Apex isn't part of the Atlas (yet) because it has all requirements to be considered as a map. It has to be activated over the map device, and it can drop maps which have a higher tier than one, which is only possible in maps. The Apex and Alluring Abyss is an endgame content which has been introduced quite a while ago and is still done by a lot of players. I even think that it is one of the biggest endgame contents done by many players. To guarantee some variety to those runs, I would really love to see some different mods being applied to this area. It is already pretty great, but it can furthermore be enhanced by adding it to the Atlas, making it possible to be affected by Sextant mods. Does anyone else have the same opinion? I'd like to hear what the community thinks about it. Maybe the upcoming new big patch would then be a good possibility if GGG gets a bit feedback from us.

UNC is trying to tell the NCAA that, while there were some egregious errors made by our academic partners at UNC, the NCAA has absolutely ZERO say in what can and cannot be taught at UNC (or any other institution). The NCAA is greatly overstepping their boundaries here. It's one thing for the NCAA to say that it's against the rules for a player to receive help on a course (via a tutor helping), but it's much more dangerous for the NCAA to claim an entire class as an impermissible benefit. Do we really want to give the NCAA this kind of power? Do you want the NCAA to take a look at the classes that your student-athletes are taking, and be able to determine the legitimacy of those classes? Truly ask yourself that. Do the athletes (and regular students) take easy classes at your school? Now, keep in mind that UNC has already admitted that these classes were essentially a sham. They weren't ""fake"" as so many like to call it. All the class required was a paper at the end of the year. You could still fail the class by failing to write a paper. The 'sham' part was that the professor wasn't doing the grading, and he wasn't even in the classroom. He was off doing research because he didn't give a damn. The news of this easy class caught on, and Athletes, frat boys, and the lucky few who caught word jumped on the class and took it for the easy A. What UNC has said to the NCAA is that this is an Academic issue which we have already taken up and been punished by our accreditor (SACS). This isn't part of your jurisdiction. The NCAA, though, has other ideas. Do we really want the NCAA to expand their jurisdiction? TL;DR: Would you really want the NCAA to be given the power to say what is and isn't a real class?","While all that is true, I hate Carolina so I want to see them punished",

If you imagine a rubber band breaking from being stretched too much that's basically what a tow or recovery strap does when it breaks except it's moving at speeds that will kill you if you get in the way, the dampener stops this by ""absorbing"" the energy and making it fall to the ground.

White people were not the first ones to start enslaving others. That would be Africans, who then sold their own off to become part of the Arab slave trade. But it was white people who were the first to be willing to go to fucking war to end the practice of slavery. I hope this professor gets everything he has coming to him.

Mental disorders very rarely occur in a singularity and almost always co-occur with at least one other disorder.

"The metric system is undeniably easier to use than Imperial, but it is hampered by its connection to our decimal system. While Imperial is a hopeless jumble of different units and conversions, you'll notice that many of these units, in a vacuum, are actually quite nice. The inch is one such example. Twelve is a much nicer number than ten. Ten already reaches for the decimal mark with such a common fraction as one fourth and is completely hopeless when it comes to thirds. Consider seconds/minutes/hours which are counted in 60 and 12 (or 24 or whatever). These are also really nice numbers. You can use minutes to measure half-an-hour, quarter til, ten past, etc. and you'll still have a whole number because 60 has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60 as divisors. This could be possibly be a partial reason why the French attempt to establish decimal time never took off.",I think (hope) you forgot this:,

"White America It's true that whites can often have a myopic view of the way race affects life; naturally it's hard to understand an experience that is specific to a certain group of people when you are not a member of that group. That being said, I'd like to see op-ed authors stop using the adjective ""white"" irresponsibly, i.e., in a manner that suggests (even if it doesn't say outright) that whites form a homogenous group of brutes who all love Trump and couldn't care less about the plight of anyone but themselves. It's insulting, patronizing, and inaccurate, and I think it has led to the feelings of marginalization that caused people to consider Trump who may not have done so otherwise. I don't think it's necessarily always true that ""if you can replace 'white' with 'black' and get a racist statement then it's wrong to say"" given the historical context of race relations in the world. BUT I do think that a sentence that fails that test deserves to be reconsidered and possibly clarified to not give the appearance of stereotyping. No one wants to be blamed for mere membership in a group, and you have to consider what people **understand** you to say and not just what you **mean** to say.","But when writing about how my group suffers, it's so much easier to stereotype the opposition!",

A couple of 70-year-olds, and the youth-vote outlier guy was even older than *that*. This election was dominated by people who were tabloid headlines when I was a teenager two decades ago. It's ridiculous. Coming up in the 1990s, it never occurred to me that my generation would be so left in the dust. I just figured we would have our moment, whether we were ready for it or not - especially given the constant marketing of ""Gen X"" (by Baby Boomers in the marketing industry) as the next big thing. Instead, we got bypassed. Outside of Nirvana and Pulp Fiction, nobody even thinks about my generation.

Does the Scorpio reveal include ONLY tech demos or new game trailers? Is VR a part of either E3 or the reveal show? Is there even a reveal show to begin with or do you just reveal and announce everything at E3 and bury all your exclusive game announcements? There are a trillion questions here that need to be answered. I'm not exactly sure how I would approach it all. I think you have to have a hardware reveal date. There has to be a show and there has to be some form of games. It can't be all tech talk. Just show what you can and explain what it all means. Make it last about an hour. Call it a day afterwards. Stream it on twitch. End story. People just need to know what it is and why they need it. Explain VR capability. When do you do this? Before E3. You don't need to wait until after E3. You hype the reveal a month before the reveal date. Then you have the reveal date, then you hype up E3 a month before E3, then you market it at every turn, being humble like you have been for the last 3 years.

"1 Miyamoto didn't hate Donkey Kong Country, it was a mistranslation in the original article.

And apparently recently some rumor got out that I didn't really like that game? I just want to clarify that that's not the case, because I was very involved in that. And even emailing almost daily with Tim Stamper right up until the end."" 2 Star Fox 2 was cancelled due to the closeness of the release of the Nintendo 64.

Also who the fuck remembers Croc anymore? Also how does that make Miyamoto an asshole. He apologized to Argonaut games and it seems like they just held a petty grudge over the years. 4 Also why the fuck is this on the list. This isn't about Miyamoto being an asshole. It shouldn't be here. If Miyamoto didn't have anything to say, he shouldn't be labeled an asshole.

"Something that everybody who plays Botlane ADC in any elo needs to know and understand It's going to be very painful, you're not going to believe me at first, but you direly need to know this if you want to not get misunderstood when discussing the balance state of ADCs. Allright, here we go: ADCs are not designed to win 1v1 against anybody. There, I said it. Shocking. You're most likely already typing ""lol shitpost of the week"" by now. ADCs are meant to be played with teammates. This is why we get plenty of ""ADCs are too weak!"" every day every season no matter how important ADCs are in the meta (And they've always been, except for the few weeks where Mordekaiser was better than them) This is why you see ADCs saying ""Poppy 1v1d me wtf??"" This is why you see ADCs dying because they ran down bot by themselves at 25 minutes while their Support is warding Baron and River. ADCs are Cannons. Cannons are lost if the Cavalry charges into them and kills the artillerymen. They also lose if the Infantry manages to walk up to them through the damage. This is why Cannons are protected by other troops so that they don't just get ran over by anybody. This is why you don't use Cannons only on a battlefield. That doesn't mean Cannons are weak. Cannons have changed the face of warfare for several centuries and have been one of the most impactful weaponry we've come up with. The key to be a good ADC is to understand you're a Cannon and that you're only powerful when positioned on a hill and raining hell from far away. That doesn't mean ADCs CANNOT win 1v1s, but it means there is nothing innately wrong if Ryze outduels you even though you're 1/0/1 and Ryze is 0/1/0. It means you cannot expect to outduel Shyvana when she has exhaust, ult, and a Randuin. It doesn't mean ALL ""Marksmen"" are shit at 1v1. Those who are not are usually not played in Botlane: Graves, Kindred, Quinn. If a marksman is played in Botlane instead of Mid or anywhere else, it's for a good reason: It's because the Marksman REQUIRES the presence of the Support to function. If that wasn't the case, why would we be assigning them to a lane where they have to share the XP with someone else? The polar opposite of ""ADCs that can hold their own"" is Jhin. Jhin can 100-0 a bruiser with his ult... But he has to stand still and can only shoot in a cone in front of him. Just... just like a cannon. When Jhin was released people tried playing him in Mid and whatever other positions - And failed. Because Jhin is the perfect example of the ""team marksman"". By himself, he gets killed by roughly anybody. With his team, he provides one of the biggest ranged executes and output of physical damage. If you want to 1v1 people and currently main adc... it's not too late to change your role.

"So, clearly different mediums present action, and therefore feats, differently. For example, manga tends to depict speed much more dramatically than western comics. So, I have (potentially stupid and weird) question: how strong would various characters be as depicted in different mediums? Admittedly, this is a little abstract and objective feats become difficult to use. Instead, a lot might be based on context, power-scaling, or medium-based tropes. An example might be helpful: * Avatar characters are routinely argued to be much slower than comic characters. However, if we placed them in a Marvel comic, they would almost certainly dodge bullets at some point. * Similarly, Cap. America doesn't really do crazy blur speed stuff or ""shonen jumps"" (a new term for me) that often, or at all. However, license him to a manga and he might.

To claim that an engineer who managed to persuade Jobs of anything still must lack people skills, is not very plausible. To claim that he isn't suitable as a wage slave, completely ignores that he applied for such a job. To claim he would loose Apple customers because he's an engineer is outright insane. Don't buy the shit they pull out their asses, just so they can continue to deny reality.",He probably doesn't understand how Apple products work...,"So, based on your Reddit comments, do you think you might be the one lacking people skills here?"

"It's pretty unfair to hold it against Kobe that he played with Shaq, Kobe was still in his early years in those threepeat Lakers and people forget that. Kobe than went and lead the Lakers on his own, and if you hold it against Kobe that he played with Shaq, should I hold it against Jordan and Lebron that they played with multiple stars as well? I mean come on Jordan had Pippen and Rodman, both hall of famers. Lebron won his Miami rings with Wade and Bosh, then won again with Love and Irving. While Kobe won his back to back with Gasol.

Since Comey failed to recommend an indictment, all evidence that has come to light has done nothing but make them look like they either got played for fools or that they were in on a deal.

"My(25M) GF(25F) of 2 months who cheated on her ex with me has decided to travel long distance to see him for 'closure'. He doesn't know he was cheated on. Hi all. This is a bit long winded, so bear with me. I appreciate anyone's patience in reading. There are two primary issues in this post as you will read, they are sort of separate and I would very much appreciate advice on both. I met my current GF in May of this year. We clicked instantly: it was/is unlike any connection I've had with anyone else. She was in a relationship at the time, but judging by how emotionally close we became it was clear to me that she was no longer mentally in her current relationship. I just bided my time and took things as they came. In the two months from us meeting up to her cheating on her ex with me, she only visited him once. She later admitted to me that she had intended to go through with the breakup during that visit but it did not happen and should have. Bizarrely when we were still beating around the bush about our feelings for each other (ie. still hanging out purely as platonic friends), when I finally enquired about her boyfriend, she told me a few things and mentioned that ""he thought I was going to break up with him that weekend - haha - and I was like 'no!!'. What a misunderstanding."" After about 2 months of knowing each other, it became too much and too obvious what was going on. So I told her how I felt and she echoed the same back at me. But the entire situation was ambiguous: even though we started some physical contact in hand holding and our feelings were in the open she still said she didn't know what to do. This carried on throughout the group trip we were on, with the cheating gradually escalating. At the very end of the trip, we were essentially behaving like a couple and everyone else on the trip thought as much. I took some extra time in the location of the trip, while everyone else travelled home including her. This meant we had a solid week away from each other to process what had just happened. Her then boyfriend also had plans to visit her the coming weekend and she told me that she would decide what would happen before he visited. She broke up with him over the internet before he could visit. I foolishly thought that this would mean we would be together once I returned home. Once I got home we met for lunch and she was completely cold to me. By the end of the lunch after outpourings of emotion, we were hugging and kissing but she said she needed more time to work things out in her own head. About a week later we met up again - this was to be the decider. We spent the whole day together and I waited for her to say something, she didn't so I broached the matter. She reiterated what she said previously, that even though she had feelings for me, she thought she needed time on her own to work out her own problems. I definitely couldn't argue with that. I told her that's fine but we proceeded to have a very emotional conversation anyway -- I felt completely heartbroken and inexplicably emotionally exhausted after all of the anxiety and constant wondering for the previous 10 or so weeks. It concluded and she had stood her ground. As we proceeded back to my car she suddenly lagged behind me. I turned around and saw that she didn't look alright - then she vomited an enormous amount all over where she was standing. We didn't say much, got back in the car and I drove her home. For the entire car journey (30ish minutes) neither of us said anything. When we arrived at her house she looked at me and said ""There's only been two times in my life where my body has completely overridden my mind"" ... ""let's give it a shot."" And so we started seeing each other from then on. She did say that things were all a bit intense with her ex and that she didn't want that again and I was in no rush either after a very intense relationship had ended for me about 9 months previously. Fast forward to now, as there were no bumps along the way until now, and all of a sudden she landed it on me that she was going to visit her ex (which involves flying to that city). When she first said that to me, it came across to me like there might be something in their meeting so my first response was ""excuse me? but we're together?"" To which she replied an ambiguous ""mm..well.."", which came as an absolute shock to me but was also just very poorly timed on her part as that was a separate issue to what she was telling me. She clarified that she wasn't going there to stay with him or anything, that she wants to have proper closure on the situation with him because she had broken up with him over the internet, suggesting that this was the respectful thing to do. I have no issue with that in principle, but my issue is that he still does not know that she cheated on him with me OR that we are in fact seeing each other now. I feel like if I was in that guy's shoes, there's no way in hell I'd want her to visit - and I'd feel doubly manipulated that she thought she could visit me for her own peace of mind while hiding the elephant in the room. I expressed this to her but she insisted that it was irrelevant and had nothing to do with the breakup and those facts would cause him unnecessary hurt. My own view on that is that she could just not tell him but not seek to visit him and leave it as it is, but that if she is going ahead with visiting him (and she is) that he should definitely know these things before she travels. Additionally, I asked her if there was a chance that going there would have an effect on our relationship - she was definite and certain that it absolutely would not. Before this next part, I should specify two things: *1.* that she is on anti-depression medication and said her life had gone down the drain from last September up until about this April and *2.* she obsessively rationalises emotional matters; trying to shut out the emotions and think of the 'correct' or 'rational' thing to do in any situation. On the other issue of her ""mm..well.."" response, she told me several things as regards to this. She said that she did not feel like she could be called anyone's 'girlfriend' at this point in time. She said she wished she could give a full effort to our relationship and that if she were to ""throw caution to the wind"", she would. With that said on her part, its not as if I have felt a lack of affection (although she is naturally just not a madly or overtly affectionate person) from her or not felt intense happiness from her when we are together - quite the opposite. We both said that we are happy with the way things are and that there was no need to de-escalate or escalate or force things in any direction. From my point of view, we are essentially in a relationship - call it whatever but that is what it is. It's nothing insanely serious or intense, but it is still a committed and exclusive relationship. I told her this, she agreed but said that she can't call it that in her own head. Although she has brought me to meet several of her friends already, she told me that with most of them she just referred to me as 'a guy' - but at the same time it was obvious we were together. She told me that ""I don't feel I can be (her name) to you right now when I can't even be (her name) to myself."" She said she plays it down in her own head. I suggested we break up if it's just ambiguous to her and that she could turn around at any time and say that she has issues and that it isn't working for her. She replied that it wouldn't be the case - she was definite about her feelings for me and that she wants to be with me still. All insights, experiences, thoughts, advice very much welcome and appreciated. Thank you for reading this far. --- **tl;dr**: Met girl at start of summer who was taken and we clicked insanely well. Things heated up and she cheated on him with me. She broke up with him shortly after, but said that it was coming anyway and should have happened earlier. We almost didn't end up together, but did after a bit of drama. Straight sailing from there, until now. Two months in; we're in a relationship; talk all the time and see each other regularly; she suddenly drops it on me that she is travelling (long distance) to see her ex for 'closure' because the breakup was via internet. Her ex has no idea that he was cheated on or that we are now together. She does not plan to tell him these things either to ""save unnecessary hurt."" Qs: Should she tell him these facts BEFORE she travels so that he can make a fully informed decision on whether HE wants to meet or not? What do you think she means by closure in this scenario? What would you do in my shoes?","Golden rule to live by: ""People who cheat with you will cheat on you"".",

"This can't be stressed enough. Guns are always loaded! I was part of an accidental discharge indoors years ago. I went hunting with a lever action rifle really early one morning. I loaded the gun at 5 am and walked off into the woods. Around noon I called it a day, seeing nothing the whole morning. I got back to the house and unloaded the rifle, except I was pretty sure that there were 2 more rounds left in it. So i fiddled around with it for a while and ran the action around many times and gave up, deciding That maybe inwas tired and didnt load as many as i thought. Later on that day someone else picked up the gun and was looking at it. (Really nice lever action rifle). The person began running the lever repeatedly and nothing chambered or ejected. The person, feeling satisfied the gun was empty ran the action again and pulled the trigger. What should have been a click turned out to be a bang. The aftermath was a .44 magnum into the face of a TV which thankfully lodged there and didnt go into or through the wall of the house. After the initial shock of this all he ran the action 2 more times and 2 more rounds came out of the rifle. My point here is really freaky shit happens and guns malfunction and have things like this happen (rounds stuck in the tube). What saves lives in these situations are the basic safety concepts. Thankfully the person that did this was really good about always pointing the gun in a safe direction, so no injuries occurred. Always remember that gun accidents are scary and empty guns can still never be trusted. If someone is handling a gun in a way the makes you uncomfortable please let them know or remove yourself from the situation as quickly as possible.",That's why you always look down the barrel to make sure there are no bullets,

"German 380mms now useless vs new 28mm bow ends As some people were thinking the bow changes with everything tier 8-10 becoming 28mm means the 380mm german BB guns don't benefit from overmatch. I've had about 5 games in the test client so far, North callies all over the place so perfect opportunity for seeing the change, firing at the front resulted in most broadsides with a north callie nose on to a bismarck with 5-6 ricohet hits and the odd occasion 1150 overpen results. The resulting return fire? Full 8-15k damage through the front of the bismarck's Bow armour by the north callies 16inch guns and it didn't matter on the angle you approach, your either gimping your return fire by only having 4 barrels on or stopping any of the secondaries for being able to fire due to angle. So grats, it the 28mm bow armour nerf works fine with any other BBs which weld 16inch guns to fire at the enemy but you completely gimp any german BB with 380mms guns. If this change goes through its going to relegate bismarcks to 2nd line or back line firing, which means the whole turtleback and good secondaries characteristics and in turn brawling german BBs are made null and void and completely craps all over the design concept of the german tree. Its as bad as the design choice to include the izumo, which is equally shit on with this change as its only saving point was bow on and firing its guns, well good luck with that with 28mm bow armour nerfs because its going to die in a couple of broadsides through the front now. I'm a avid BB driver, some 2k+ games in them, I play hard and fast closing in and not one of those backline campers, but this change will make me either A. not bother closing within 18km of a target B. drop german BBs especially outright and have serious thoughts about doing any other BB line from now on. These changes don't promote more brutality, it makes it even more costly than before and the economy changes do jack squat diddly to reward the gameplay style WG seems to be smoking up, it makes it far worse and far less rewarding to close range and it certainly doesn't encourage BB vs BB combat anymore than now. I cannot endorse this armour changes with so many design flaws visible in it.","How about instead of going bow-on, go stern-on and snipe?",

I was teaching a class of 25 students (about 20 male, all black or Hispanic) about searches and seizures, and I wanted to use the random searches they conduct in subways as a vehicle for discussion. So I asked, ""have any of you been searched by a police officer in the last year in the subway?"" All 25 of them raised their hands. Most of them stated that they had been searched multiple times, some said dozens of times in the last year. These kids were like, 13-15 years old. I have lived in New York City for three years. I am white. I have never been searched. The two white lawyers with me have never been searched, both have lived here longer.

These event entries only appear after the Divorce Update was pushed onto my machine. I tried completely reinstalling the latest drivers, but it doesn't help.

The chrome 'local state' tweak no longer works ether. Its completely ignored, and launches windows store regardless. Today I tried to play some xcom. But it wouldn't launch. Somehow some of the files were corrupted, according to steam. That's when I noticed the larger problem. Everything on my computer is now read-only.

"Yeah, as others have said the person who found the plates admitted to have taken them out, so the most important thing, that the evidence scene was altered, was already established and uncontested. On a related note, funny how the cremains were less important in this regard and weren't photographed because the scene was altered, yet they took their time to photograph the plates. It boggles the mind how the jury and PW accepted these bogus excuses when it came to no photo evidence of the cremains *in situ*. To return back to the topic at hand, why would they lie about the pics and how the plates were found? My first guess is that the fireman didn't place them back in right away but taken them to someone. That someone then placed them back in the car from the wrong side and took this terrible, terrible photograph (PS: the bad quality is acceptable only if Brutus was the ""officer"" that took it). This series of events, which could have happened, implies a greater tampering with the scene so they wanted to downplay that, because this was an important piece of evidence. That's why they ""slightly altered"" how the events unfolded in their testimonies, imho. Or it could simply be that they were really so incompetent that they couldn't even get the photo right without any agenda behind it. Regardless, I doubt that the plates were put right back in as per their testimonies, meaning they were outside of the car for a longer period of time and only placed back in to get a ""convincing photo"" for the trial. TL/DR: I agree that this seems like the driver's side of the car meaning the plates were photographed from the wrong side.

"For lack of better phrasing, I think the death screen should promote nicer gaming. Mainly by allowing friend requests and compliments to your killer Gonna take a quick break from the salt to remind people that every player is still a person behind a screen, and I think it'd do good to include the option to send friend requests or compliments(pressing it sends the killer ""[player] has complimented you on your fighting skills"" or something) on the death screen as a big visible button. I'm aware that you can PM them or send the friend request in the chat feed, but I think making it a button on the death screen reminds people to have a little bit more humility and sportsmanship, and is much more likely to get used. And by allowing for a general compliment like we have a general taunt, it would allow people to send nice gestures without having to break from the action or get super involved in their compliment, which may turn them away from making the gesture in the first place. This isn't due to anything recent, and was more just a musing on how to slightly improve in game interaction.

Some nurses love having an extra helper and others see students as a bother and slowing them down. Find the ones that are knowledgeable but also don't mind or like answering your questions. Once I started working as I nurse, I realize the nurses that didn't like to answer my questions or having a student nurse was because they didn't know how to answer questions or they were unethical in their practice. This awkward phase of standing around and not knowing what to do is very common btw. It happens in every clinical setting when you're new. Don't let it get to you. The best way to help is to ask the nurse if they need help with anything, following them to help with procedures without being asked and help so they know you actually want to learn.

"The Spurs' recent dominance directly coincides with Kawhi's surging offense Kawhi Leonard | PPG | Record w/ Kawhi | Record w/out Kawhi ---|---|---|--- 2014-15 season before 2/28 | 14.8 | 26-14 (.650) | 9-9 (.500) Remainder of 2014-15 regular season | 19.3 | 20-4 (.833)| --- 2015-2016 regular season | 21.2 | 60-12 (.833) | 7-3 (.700) The record without Kawhi last season obscures how important he's been to the team: the combined winning percentage of their opponents in those games was .398. I don't know what happened in late February of 2015, but Kawhi's PPG *jumped* about 5 points almost overnight, and the Spurs started crushing everybody. The difference is stark as hell, and makes me think that if Kawhi keeps improving, the Spurs will win 60+ games yet again. As for Kawhi's continued improvement, his points per minute has increased at least 15% every season, and if he does that this season he'd score 24.5 PPG. The biggest increase (last season) was about 24%, and if he does that again this season, he'd score 26.2 PPG. That might have seemed crazy a week ago, but things change.","Nah man, it's all the system.",

"The importance of RAM When I initially built this PC with a i5-6600k and R9 390, it had 8gb DDR4 Ram. Games I played like TW3, Mankind Divided etc. would run, but would have problems at high-ultra settings. FPS would drop from 60 to 30 then back to 60 again. In Mankind Divided, the FPS would drop down to 4-5. I had a look around and asked some questions, but most people just said that these games might be poorly optimised, or that my hardware just isn't good enough to run Ultra. I had a look at RAM usage which was at 6/8gb only. I decided to risk it, upgraded my ram to 16gb. The usage instantly jumped up to 13/16gb. I ran the games and now they all sit smoothly at 60FPS on high-ultra. TLDR: At the level of a 390 or higher, you need 16gb for many games to not bottleneck. The days of the 8gb has long passed for medium-high end users.",Am I good with 32Gb?,

"Most rock songs are written very simply and usually each member of a band comes up with their own parts, and usually it is not super precise and specific, lots of room for improvisation and such. This is why having a band with good chemistry is so important- if they can't play together without sounding like ass it doesn't matter how good of a musician each of them is individually- this is also why people were skeptical of supergroups like Led Zeppelin initially. EDM is written entirely differently, usually 1 or 2 producers write all of the parts and has them act in sync with eachother. They meticulously tweak every sound and every note in the song so that nothing is clashing. Every sound is hand-picked, and then modified with various effects and EQ's to get it to sit right in the mix. Even when the melodies/chords are simple, EDM producers still need to spend hours doing precise work to get everything to sound right, and often times they can't do that with just EQ- sometimes they need to change the parts of certain instruments entirely because those parts were clashing with some other part, which is in many ways similar to how a classical composer needs to write the part of each instrument so that they compliment eachother rather than fight eachother. In that way, EDM is a lot more similar to classical music than rock is. Some people would argue that some types of metal are closer with their complicated time signatures and guitar gymnastics but I still think that while EDM is more ""simplistic"" sounding it's still closer just due to the amount of time and precision required to make a track.",But but to make edm all you need is to push buttons on a computer,

I'm a former project manager for a games company and so I might have a little different perspective from those who haven't worked in that industry.

Some were in PM, others in community management and communications. Through the past 4 years Ive also seen amazing things produced. The benefits of having no publisher and the huge crowd-sourced funding has covered up a lot of mistakes that other projects would fall to.

"Hey, ex-rioter (don't tell anyone I'm undercover) So, I worked on the brazilian player support team at riot, which was really close to the community team and the player behaviour team, so when this kinda popped the first time I went to discuss this with our player behaviour expert. Turns out that this would be a relly great idea in paper, but we had to account for the players that would be using it. I can't give you all the details because my memory sucks and I don't want to say something wrong (I'm not the expert on this), but it turns out that having an option like this would induce players to single out a bad player on their team (due to their poor performance, for instance) so they would quit and the team would be granted a mercy. Not only that but players would also be able to abuse this on a duo system, where one of them quits and the team gets mercy. These are very hard to counter since you can't know for sure if someone just dc'ed or quitted. Also I don't know if this would affect overwatch but the matchmaking on LoL is fucking complicated, which means that a team going up on the ladder and a team not moving at the same time could cause some issues (imagine not one, but hundreds of these). After working there I know it's pretty damm hard to get a system that feels fair for everyone, because unfortunately people will find a way to abuse it, and if it's abusable then it's not functional, that's why system with less possible abuse were added to league (like the remake on the first minutes of the game). A system should not ever, ever, create toxicity and by god that's hard","ah, the brTT effect",

How to balance all the missions with this one weird trick Track all mission completions by type. Every [week] increase the reward from the least done mission type by [2%] and decrease the reward from the most done mission type by [1%].

"Tips to a mediocre Crucible player on finishing the First Curse quest? So as mentioned in the title I'm a distinctly average PvP player, haha maybe less not quite sure. I hover around a .6 KD and if I finish a round above 1.0 I'm happy with myself. However I really do understand a lot of the basic strategy involved in Crucible. Been reading the Playbook since it, and feel have a solid grasp on the basic physics, gun archetypes, disengaging, team shooting etc. But due to a combination of never having really taken a PvP shooter seriously before Destiny, and a chronic illness that tends to affect my reaction times/ ability to make split second decisions. I often seem to simply get outplayed even when tactically I should have had the upper hand. While I know I really should likely use a pulse or AR, I just love hand cannons and that Last Curse is taunting my almost complete collection. (Particularly since the high impact HC is a contender again) I have one good friend I usually play with (1.1 KD). And have other friends I know would be willing to lend a hand. I'm just not sure what the best strategy is. Any thoughts, advice or insight much appreciated. Thanks fellow Guardians!",Aim for the head!,

No. History will be very unkind to him. You can make a rather legitimate argument that he is the worse President of all time. His role in creating the power vacuum to precipitate ISIS is worse than Buchanan's botches leading to the Civil War. His actions to recovery the economy were less effective than Hoover. His Iran deal is worse than Carter's dealing with Iran. His surrender in Iraqi is worse than W's dubious reasons for conquering them. Drone strike assassinations are arguably a war crime. The illegal wars in Libya and Yemen et. al. have killed far more people than Jackson's Trail of Tears. So what good things did he do?

Insulting the opposing campaign manager is not surprising however I've heard Karl Rove and David Axelrod be called a lot of things but never the assistant manager of a whorehouse. It seems likely that particular insult was chosen only because she is a woman. It also seems like a veiled way of calling her a whore.

"My superb witch game (A story of teamwork) Night 1: I find the godfather. Day 2: Basically, I need to communicate to him that I'm the witch, without raising eyebrows/giving him away to the Spy, if there is one. So I whisper to (A Cockroach) ""I investigated you as bg/gf/arso last night. I'm assuming you're bodyguard. If you protect me, I think we can make a great team"" He plays along, and unfortunately as we are whispering, the town has already lynched his mafioso. We both voted guilty. Later that night, the jailor executes his framer, so the mafia is off to a terrible start. The good news is, Cockroach manages to find and kill the jailor on the same night. As I'm finding roles, I'm realizing when they ask me for wills, they're going to piece together that I'm investigating the same people who were witched. So I switch things up, saying I visited the Jailor night 2 and the medium a different night. Believe it or not, I find the retributionist the next night, when he's trying to revive the jailor. I go ahead and whisper to my godfather buddy, ""____ came up med/jan/ret, guessing retributionist. Not sure why, but I'll check him again tonight."" Sure enough, the godfather takes him out as I witch him again to prevent a disaster. The next day, I'm asked for a role claim. Right before though, a townie named Dux says ""I'm TK."" So I quickly type in my will, Dux = Vig/Vet/Mafioso. Then I paste my will, and claim investigator. Then they immediately turned to Cockroach, but I quickly said he's clean, as I marked him as ""TOWN"" in my will. Bodyguard was dead at this point, so I couldn't exactly mark him that way. The godfather and I are constantly whispering every day in attempt to work together, because we assume the real investigatives remaining are sheriff, who is useless at this point, and lookout. He tells me to check a specific user, because he believes they're NK. I do so, and discover he's arsonist, forcing him to douse Dux. The town is intent on lynching the lookout claim because of ""too many TI claims"" and when there's about 5 seconds left of judgement, I quickly type ""he came up Lookout/forger/amne"" and click innocent. He's lynched on a 3-2 vote, and I pray that he's actually lookout. He is. So I control the arsonist again while constantly revealing roles to the Godfather, until eventually Dux remains, along with the arsonist, Cockroach, myself, and an unknown town role. The town finally catches on that Cockroach is godfather, and tries lynching him. So I claim that I'm doused, meaning there are 2 townies doused and it would make sense to lynch the arsonist first. (Loyalty to the Godfather) Dux whispers me, asking for a role confirmation, and I post him my will that's carefully edited. He tells me to innocent the arsonist, and that he's going to shoot the unknown town role, thinking they're the witch. I guilty him anyways, and ask for a claim outloud from the unknown role. He claims veteran. I'm thinking to myself, this is perfect. Now I can control Dux to shoot himself (incase he has any revelations), and Cockroach knows not to visit the veteran that night. That happens, and we lynch the veteran on the last day. ""I told you we'd make a great team.""",Godfitch sex after?,

I did not care, because I had only invited him, because he was my friend. But some friends told me he was making gossip and said I was interested on him. zzzzzzzz. That's something I always thought it's strange in the church. You can not have friends of the opposite sex. When I talk to someone (a boy/man) from the church, even though I'm no longer a member, I always have this feeling that the person thinks I want to date him or I like him. It's super weird. Since I was not born in the church and I was a convert, I always had male friends and it was normal. But my relationship with members of the opposite sex was really strange in the cult.",So when did you realize you were into him?,

"The wish had been innocent enough. After all, an innocent soul had requested it. Nobody had expected the fallout from the wish, though. Least of all the child. The little one had wished for all of the fossil fuels on earth to disappear, in an attempt to stop global warming and save the planet. Unfortunately, he hadn't specified that those sources be replaced with an alternate energy source right away. Within 24 hours, every last bit of fossil fuel on earth vanished into thin air. The first and most obvious effect had been the earthquakes. With several billion litres of the fluids and gases gone from under the surface, the fissures in which they'd been located were suddenly empty voids. With nothing there to support the empty reservoirs, they shifted and fell, the earth above tumbling into the holes. Plates lurched as sections of stone, previously reinforced by the fluidic pressure of the stored oil in their honeycombed structures, collapsed . Tens of thousands died in those initial shocks. But those were just the beginning of the chaos. Not only did the unprocessed fuels disappear, so did the processed ones. All the gas, diesel, lubricants... gone. The boy had specifically said he wanted them all gone, so *everything* disappeared. With transportation networks virtually crippled overnight, society fell into chaos. Sure, there were a few electric powered vehicles and planes, and some sailing ships, but the global transport and supply network we'd come to depend on vanished like a fart in the wind. What you had at hand was what would keep you alive. Suddenly, the trendy 'local food challenge' became a literal matter of life or death. If you couldn't find and eat food where you lived, you either picked up and moved or starved to death. Those who lived in areas where they were lucky enough to have 'green' energy supplies, like solar or hydroelectric dams, continued to be blessed with electricity for the short term. Those who depended on coal plants were quickly plunged into darkness. People who depended on nuclear power thought they were in the clear, only to be shocked as the plants shut down one by one... with no diesel generators to power emergency systems, the decision was made to shut the reactors down to avoid potential meltdown scenarios. Perhaps more importantly, many of the critical medical technologies we had taken for granted depended on a ready supply of plastics. With the oil supply gone, these supplies suddenly became rarer than gold, as they were not easily replaced. Those unlucky enough to rely on elevated tanks of municipal water systems found them depleted of drinking water in a few days. Worse, water treatment systems began to fail as the power grids collapsed. Dysentery, cholera, and other diseases thought to have been obliterated made a rapid and deadly comeback. Within a month of the child's wish, we had been reverted to a 1900's level of technology.",This makes me hate kids now.,

Hmm, sounds like a classic case of 'I know history, but I don't know history' to me!"
"I'll add to the conversation with another example: gangs. I worked with at-risk youth in Nashville for a few years where there was gang activity (not as heavy as some areas, but nevertheless an issue). There is this illusion of choice that many people think is there for these kids. ""Those kids are just looking for the easy way out. They chose to be in a gang, they should go to jail."" To a certain extent this is true, but it's necessary that people understand (at least at the very basic level) what life is like for some of these kids growing up. Mostly single parent families, providers working multiple jobs, kids going to schools which are underfunded because they are failing (and failing because there is a lack of resources). Their friends are in gangs, their cousins are in a gang, their older sibling might be in a gang, and worse their parent might be in a gang. If being safe or being part of your family (if you have one) means you join a gang, what would you do? One day, you get offered $100 to stand on the street and signal when you see the cops. You have to skip school in order to do it, but you are 10 years old and it's $100! That's how much your provider makes in two whole days! Would you keep going to school? Your provider went to school and is struggling to make enough money for you to eat working all hours of the day... Too many people don't realize how different/difficult it is for some kids to simply grow up, let alone do well in life.",Then why they still got bootstraps?,

"I agree with you on that. But how do you make certain your supposed evidence is not an artifact of the experiment? Answer me that. Here's an example to help you think of an answer. Suppose you have two electronic bathroom scales on which you weight yourself every morning, scale A and scale B. They are located on opposite sides of the bathroom. One morning you weigh yourself on scale A which reads 150 lbs. Then you weigh yourself not 5 seconds later on scale B and it reads 175 lbs. Perplexed over this (and unwilling to spend money on a new scale) you collect data on the scales over the next 60 days. Scale A has 60 data points all at 150, just like you'd expect (assume an independent source has measured you at 150 lbs too, like your doctor, who uses the same scale as your bathroom scale and is properly calibrated). But scale B measures 175 lbs with a little bit of variation each day. You do a statistical test and find the results of scale B are statistically significant. What is your most reasonable conclusion and course of action? Is it to 1. Surmise there is an unknown systematic you have not accounted for in scale B (e.g. faulty wiring or something) or that the scale is not calibrated correctly, which you proceed to try and discover and remedy? 2. Conclude the local gravitational field around scale B is different, so you write a paper on it claiming you have found a flaw in Einstein's equations?",Launch Scale B in to space obviously,

"Several people in my office are showing an interest in anti-Capitalist movements and have asked me to recommend books and materials to them. Any tips on how to handle this? Quick background on myself: I obtained my degree in Philosophy and Classical Greek, and I currently work in IT at an absolutely massive (Fortune 100) company. I'm not the smartest person in the world, but I'm not a dummy, either. I came to my anarchist / socialist / communist views by reading through some of the history of economic ""greats"" like Smith, Marx, Kropotkin, etc. I've read more recent authors, too, but they're usually people like Piketty. Over the last couple of years, I've had some very gentle conversations with people in my office - I know our views can be scary at first, and I thought it would be best to ask questions, present future concerns (like automation), things like that. Since we're in IT, a lot of this centers around technology and the role of technology in the world. Recently, a few guys have asked me for more material. While they're definitely very smart guys, I know they're not going to enjoy coming at this stuff from the way I did it. Is there any short, accessible, and if possible at least somewhat entertaining material you can all recommend? Anything from books to videos to audio / podcasts will work. I told them I'd compile a few things and get back to them. I'd like to avoid anything *too* overt to begin with. They're still under the impression that anarchism means angry people burning stuff, socialism is big government control, and communism is totalitarian dictatorships. If I hand them something extolling the virtues of each, I'm afraid they'll bolt before they have a very clear understanding. But they're definitely at a point where they're willing to listen. I've never had this happen before, and I'm feeling just a little lost.",Send them to reddit,

"If baseball careers were treated as individual people who aged in dog years, what are some interesting careers that approximate famous historical figures? For example, I feel like Jose Bautista is the Harriet Tubman of baseball. In 1849, at the age of 27, Tubman was not highly valued as a slave due to illness. Her owner, Edward Brodess, tried to sell her but was having difficulty finding a buyer. Tubman then prayed that God would kill him for attempting to sell her, and a week later Brodess perished. Knowing that this likely meant that she and her family would be split up and sold separately to the highest bidders, it became a catalyst that urged her and her brothers to escape. Shortly thereafter, she and her brothers became fugitive slaves. Traveling around to safe houses, like vagabonds. It wasn't until Dec 6 1865, that she would officially be free of any reprise or force-able return under the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850. Tubman would've been 43 at the time. She would go on to become one of the greatest historical figures in american history due to her work prior to and after the ratification of the 13th amendment, but not allowed to truly flourish until the later part of her life. Similarly, when Bautista tried to enter professional baseball in 1999, he had been offered a minor league contract with a 300K signing bonus from the Reds. Marge Schott then sold the team and the club pulled it's offer. No other team would offer him anywhere near that amount of money so he ended up going to juco. He excelled, showing lots of promise, and became a 20th round draft-and-follow prospect for the Pirates in 2000. They signed him and he quickly became a touted prospect. He continued to educate himself and hone his craft, finally getting his chance to play in the big leagues in 2004, at the age of 23. What else happened in 2004? Marge Schott died. So you see, both he and Tubman had a malevolent owner who died just prior to the rapid acceleration of their quality of life. From december of 2003, to the end of the 2004 season (approximately 6 baseball dog years), Bautista, like Tubman, would bounce around from city to city. Nowhere was safe for too long, as he was given up on by 5 teams who didn't want to take the risk on him. Constantly on the move, he had no sense of true freedom, but he was happy to be in a better spot than he was when he started his journey. So close, yet so far away. It wouldn't be until his 7th dog year season that he would break out and be truly free. That's roughly around the same age in human years as Tubman was when the 13th amendment was ratified. Jose would then go on to have a very strong second half of his baseball dog life. Currently at 91 ML dog years, Bautista is on the verge of outpacing Tubman, who was 90 or 91 when she died. So, I admit this comparison may begin to fall apart if Bats puts together 2-3 more seasons without looking like a ghost.",This is kinda insulting to Harriet Tubman.,

"Elizabeth Warren is doing zero introspection into why they lost. She is not acknowledging at all that the working middle class abandoned the Democrats this election in massive numbers. I mean, these people voted for Obama the last 2 times, and Trump this time. Why did they go for Trump? Is Elizabeth addressing reconnecting her party to the working class? No, all I hear is ""We won the popular vote!"" Yes, and you can thank the Southern California regions, particularly LA county where Hillary dominated in a landslide (There's like 15 million people in this area). However, she is not addressing the rest of the states, where if you remove California, but actually, not even California, just the massively dense population of Los Angeles and the surrounding area, Trump won 49 states by 2.2 million votes. I am not saying the LA votes don't count, don't get me wrong. My point is though that her dwelling on this popular vote thing is going to change nothing. Ya, Southern California might agree with you, but holy crap, look at Michigan. Obama won that by like 10% 4 years ago. He won Wisconsin by 8%. He won places like Iowa by around 10% in 2008 and 7% in 2012. Trump won Iowa with 9% more. Think about that for a second... 4 years ago compared to now, there was a 16% swing from Democrat to Republican. But no, all Warren can talk about is, ""But we won the popular vote thanks to Southern California!"" Honestly, I lost respect for Warren when I realized she was just another opportunist politician that likes to say stuff people want to hear, but at the end of the day, has no true conviction. Look at the primary. She has videos condemning Hillary as a corrupt ""pay for play"" person. She has videos on youtube describing how Hillary changed her vote on the bankruptcy regulations after getting campaign donations from big wallstreet donors. Yet, when word got rumored Hillary might be considering her for VP, after she already chose not to endorse Bernie, she 180'd and couldn't stop talking about how wonderful Hillary was and how fantastic she was. How Hillary was *beyond rapport.* Now, the campaign is over, and no longer is she the outsider challenging her own party, but she has become a full-fledged, card-carrying member of the establishment. She is now, imo, part of the problem with the Democrats where she can't even see past their own failures to connect with the American people. There is a reason why the Democrats lost what used to be unquestionably BLUE states... Did she address that at all? NOPE. It's not like the electoral college is going to change. It's part of the constitution and requires a constitutional amendment, and since the Republicans have the Presidency, the Senate, and the House, it is not going to happen. Democrats just need to accept this reality and figure out how to deal with it. Time to move on.",Let's ban voting until we can figure out what the hell is going on.,

"I used to defer for a few months, make a payment, then let it get close to the 90 days it takes to go delinquent, then defer for inability to pay again... And repeat. Several times. I got rejected for a Target card once for having awful credit and outstanding debt (still got the 10% off that purchase for applying tho!). Fortunately I'm making enough now waiting tables in fine dining to go on income based repayment and put everything on auto pay. It still hurts, but for about 4 months it's at least been going smoothly. It's funny, what I pay in loans every month could be the difference in rent that gets me living in the city i want instead of this one I despise. Or it would get me a little closer being able to take a lower paying job in the career I want and got a degree for. It could be my car payment, gas, and insurance on a nice new vehicle instead of this falling apart 1994 I drive and have to do frequent work on (read: sink money into). It could be health insurance, or the prescription meds I haven't been able to afford in years, or both. It could be seeing my out of state family (that's all of them) every month instead of not in 5+yrs. Or retirement, a 401k or any kind of investment. But no, just hundreds of dollars a month I only get to hang onto for just long enough to be taxed on it before paying into a loan that has enough interest accruing that they could just as easily be taxing it twice. All because when I was 16 and a straight A student *not* going to college wasn't even discussed. It was just constant brochures in the mail and guidance counselors making you take college prep tests and wondering if you're going to miss your early application deadlines. Because 16-17yr olds have a great understanding of what you do with $100k. And I ended up where i did because with the fat scholarship they offered it was even cheaper than staying at my state school and paying nearly the full in state tuition. I literally applied to a few colleges, got accepted with scholarship everywhere, and picked the cheapest one. *Sigh* /rant",Doesn't it make you feel better knowing that all of your sacrifices are helping a banker out there somewhere make payments on his new Mercedes?,

"Had one for my Bodyguard 380. Worked just fine, meant to imitate the size and shape of a man's wallet. When carried in a pocket by itself like jeans back pocket, I never had a problem. It's made so you can fire it without having to remove it from the holster and actually gives you more to grip than just the pistol grip. Much better than just dumping your bare pistol in your pocket with keys, coins and what not. For deep concealment it worked just fine. I let mine go when I sold the gun after I decided small 9mm's were better than a 380 and not much larger.",Yeah a holster not covering the trigger guard is a great idea,"So, who else thinks it's a great idea to carry a gun in their back pocket, next to their keys and change, and just hope for the best?"

"Which is why people should donate to charities like doctors-without-borders. It's baffling that you would argue that 93% of donations to a charity going to things besides the goal of the charity should be unsurprising.

"My LDR bf (33m) avoids telling me (24f) things because he thinks it'll make me upset, but continues to do it anyway then threatens suicide when I express my anger There have been lots of instances where my boyfriend believes it's okay to do things that he knows will make me upset and just avoids telling me to avoid fighting. He doesn't seem to understand that this is not acceptable. Just a couple of the more serious examples of this type of behavior: I had to go to the emergency room. He lives 4 hours away and so I just called him for support because I was really scared. He said I was being ""overdramatic"" and hung up (I should mention it was very serious and related to an unplanned pregnancy) The next day, come to find out, he was at a party. I told him how I felt, that it seemed like I was unimportant and he didn't care about me. He apologized. He avoided telling me that he was at a party. He avoided telling me that he was planning a trip to another country, knowing that I wasn't going to be able to go because I am in school. He just dropped it on me the day before his flight. ""I didn't want to tell you because I know it would just make you mad. This is my only chance to go (etc)"" He avoided telling me his ex was still trying to hook up with him and avoided telling me he didn't shut it down. This past week, he avoided telling me he planned a trip with his friends. The entire weekend I couldn't reach him, so I actually seriously thought something was wrong with him. Here's why: he threatens suicide when we get into a disagreement. I take it seriously because he has a history of depression and suicide attempts and was actually institutionalized for it before we met. I'm calling him, writing him on facebook, contacting his friends, even went so far as to calling police to do a welfare check, and nothing. He comes back from his trip, finally calls me back. I'm freaking out like where are you and are you OK? He said he got my messages but ""didn't want to tell me to avoid upsetting me."" WTF?? I was so angry because all he had to do was send a message ""I'm okay I don't feel like talking"" at least, so I wasn't worrying the entire weekend. I'm expressing my feelings and he starts getting worked up and threatening suicide again. At this point, I'm aware that he's doing it to stop me from bringing this up and it's extremely manipulative, but I don't want to risk telling him this in case it does push him over the edge.

"Somebody keeps dumping sheets of metal in our driveway I know this sounds really bizarre, but bear with me here. We live in a small subdivision in Nova Scotia, and almost every morning for the past few days we have found a large, single sheet of metal lying at the exit of our driveway. I'm 15 and living with my mom in a house that we own. We do not share our driveway with anyone but there are 2 other houses with driveways exiting into our cul-de-sac. Our hosue has a very long driveway that goes over a small hill so the exit of our driveway is not visible from our windows. At first we just moved the sheets to the side, so we didn't have to drive over them, but whenever we did that a new sheet would materialize overnight. The day before yesterday one of neighbors complained about the random stack of metal on our property line, so we had to ask a friend to help us move it into the shed behind the house. This night another sheet appeared. My mother is extremely weirded out by this and it's an inconvenience because they're heavy and it's easy to cut yourself on them. We can't think of a reason why anybody would be doing this and it must be costing somebody a fortune as we now have 7 sheets of metal out of nowhere. We asked both our neighbors and they don't know anything. We don't even know if we can get in trouble by putting up the metal for sale on kijiji but we don't want it cluttering up our yard or shed. And yes, the sheets of metal keep appearing within our property line. We tried leaving a car with a dashcam set to detect motion aimed at our driveway, but it was too dark for it to record anything. Weirdly enough we can't hear when it happens either. We considered calling the police but this seems like such a weird thing to call about. Do you guys have any ideas what's going on? Why would anybody be doing that? Are we allowed to just get rid of or sell the sheets of metal?","Maybe its a prank so someone could say that they had ""sheet"" on your property.",

"Yeah that's why when the Government does it they'll need to be careful with their wording. When you strictly profile someone, you match them up with a certain description.

"Is Revelations The Best Map Of Black Ops 3? Or All Time? Revelations came out about two weeks ago, and after finding out the main Easter Egg and we have high round in the back of our heads, we can pretty much rank this map on the lists. Was It A Bad Map? Definitely not. Revelations is an amazing map. Although, a lot of people don't like the map because of how zombies ended with the Easter Egg cut scene. Most people didn't like how Treyarch ended THE FINAL ZOMBIES MAP. Although, the gameplay of the map isn't that bad. The death barriers just make you're ears bleed, and in the end, it's too easy. With all the wonder weapons, training spots, and what's already in Black Ops 3, like double pack-a-punch and gobblegums, a high round attempt isn't as hard as it seems. Was It OverHyped? Wayyyyyyyyyy Over Hyped. The fact that it was the final map and they only put in two wonder weapons, and the DG-4s is incredibly lame. THE DG-4S!!! REALLY???? It just amazes me. So I think this IS NOT the best map in Black Ops Three, I personally think it's second, behind Der Eisendrache. RIP REVELATIONS :p",nope even Bus Depot is better,

But after a while he simply said ""..But I don't know if woman really should study"". I was a little confused and asked what he meant by that. And guess what his explanation was: Women shouldn't study because they just waste time and ressources because they will have kids and stay at home. I was so shocked to hear that and told him that some people don't want kids. He started to bingo me about how ""normal"" it is, that everyone changes their mind and that it will happen at some time. After telling him that my partner and I have 3 cats (I am gay and didn't feel like outing myself. Guess that would make the whole situation even more uncomfortable) he just said that we will be alone and that it is *genetic* to have kids. We *will* have kids, no choice.

"What are considered crutch weapons? I define crutch weapons as weapons that let less-skilled players perform better, but it will either develop bad habits or be suboptimal for more-skilled players. For example, the Liberty Launcher. It's more forgiving for spammy soldiers because of the clip size and it makes people easier to hit because of the projectile speed, but it's also terrible when used by experienced soldiers because the damage penalty means most classes can survive another rocket than usual. Another example, the Soda Popper. You only need to aim once to kill someone because it deals loads of damage in a single burst, but a good scout will have more potential and perform better with the stocks scattergun's 6 shots. Last example I could think of is the Direct Hit. It's very helpful for soldiers that have really poor prediction skills because the projectile speed makes it difficult to dodge so you can just click on people and you would hit them, however a soldier that can predict well will have better performance with the stock rocket launcher's splash damage.

"You know what really grinds my gears? When people call the MCU films ""safe"" When it comes to superhero movies, the internet treats Marvel and DC very differently. While Marvel films are picked apart and discredited for trivial things, DC films are always given the benefit of the doubt. Not sure why this is, but it's very annoying. The most misguided complaint about MCU films of all is that they are ""safe"". As in, they don't take risks. Even after Civil War, people still say this and it drives me nuts! So I'm just going to rant and list a bunch of major risks Marvel took that I can't believe people don't see. First of all, when their films debuted, the characters of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America were not nearly as popular as Batman, Spider-Man, Superman etc. so the fact that they bothered to give these guys their own films at all, instead of starting off with The Avengers as a team, is a major risk and shows you what kind of people these filmmakers are: risk-takers. Every other studio trying to build cinematic universes right now, especially DC, are not taking nearly as big of a risk, because Marvel has already proven that the idea can work. Then, instead of coasting on their good work in phase 1, they continued to introduce new characters IN THEIR OWN MOVIES. Giving The Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man their own films was a mind-blowing massive risk, especially without introducing their characters in earlier films. Marvel also has a tendency to ignore reputation when it comes to casting and behind-the-scenes work. Many directors and actors that work in the MCU are no-names or people who have a history of failure. James Gunn won Razzie awards before they hired him to direct Guardians of the Galaxy, and he was the perfect choice. Chris Evans was associated with a failed Fantastic Four franchise, but they saw Captain America. Robert Downey Jr was struggling to rebuild himself when he became Iron Man. All risks. This shows you what kind of people the film-makers are: risk-takers. And it shines through in the storytelling. Where else have you seen? - The conflict between the importance of private property and national security in a movie kids can enjoy (Iron Man 2) - A father and stepfather coming to respect each other without any games played by the woman between them (Ant-Man) - Two brothers who have become enemies work together to avenge their mother, only to NOT reconcile (Thor: The Dark World) - A side character who would have been easy to kill for dramatic effect that is instead allowed to live (Civil War) - A independent career woman that loses her composure and is wrong (Luke Cage) - The main character's primary love interest is someone he can never be with and she eventually just dies (Captain America series) - A long discussion with a priest about whether a murder is justifiable in a specific instance (Daredevil) - Open critique of preemptive actions taken against a nation's own citizens (The Winter Soldier) - Countless characters we support fight over a complicated issue without trivializing anyone's point of view or anyone acting out of character (Civil War, an unprecedented feat of cinema and something the comic story it was named after completely failed to do) - The threat of the main villain is an illusion and the reveal of the truth is played for laughs (Iron Man 3, don't think this one paid off but it is undeniably a huge risk) - A credible scapegoat threat is eliminated by the villain, allowing the true conflict to become more personal (Civil War) I could list many more, but these are all big risks in story-telling that I think are underappreciated by the mainstream. I do think that many critiques of the MCU are fair, like that it generally has forgettable villains, bland stakes and is sometimes too lighthearted, but the idea that the films don't take risks is utterly misguided in my opinion. Perhaps they follow their formula too often, but I am consistently surprised by elements of every film.","Nah screw all that noise, Marvel needs to kill off someone to prove that they can take risks, Oh and also they're no stakes because you know they aren't going to die.",

"I hated the weight and width of the iphone 7 plus. I've been a Note user for years and was trying to shift over to Apple because of the issues I'd always had with battery life and lag on my Android phones. My biggest needs are camera and battery life, but I had no idea how important being able to use a phone with one hand was to me until I bought the iphone 7 plus. Even though its not *that* much bigger than the Note phones I've used over the years, its JUST that bit too heavy and too wide to use with one hand for me. I also realized it was hard to take a good photo with it because of the weight making it hard to hold the phone with one hand and take photos. The weight on the iphone 7 plus was enough to make it hard to hold still. I kept wondering why all my photos were coming out looking like shit, and so I took it back to the Apple store and I was having the same issues with the iphone 7 pluses on display. When I tried out the regular size iphone 7 on display, I noticed the pictures had less blur on them. I was able to replicate it over and over. I can't hold the iphone 7 plus still enough to take good photos, and I was getting less blurry photos using the normal iphone 7. Completely surprised me.","Well, Donald Trump, if you had bigger hands it wouldn't be an issue.",

"Thornmail: One of the biggest trap items in LoL. Should it ever be made GOOD? Picture this: You're a Malphite and get over 500 armor with a Thornmail in your build, but the enemy ADC gets a Mercurial Scimitar. With that one item, Thorns becomes completely ineffective. And it's not just Mercurial Scimitar that can hard-counter Thornmail, but also a sufficient amount of lifesteal, a Death's Dance, or a Phantom Dancer. All those can make Thornmail suck. **""Get it earlier.""** Unfortunately Riot made early-Thornmail bad because the thorns scales off bonus armor. When you get it too early, it doesn't have enough bonus armor to do much damage. But if you get it late, your opponent will probably already have countered it, or will be able to change up their item composition to counter it. The big issue is that Thornmail requires too many stats to actually work, and requires that your opponent have incorrect stats as well. This is a problem akin to Spell Vamp; you need bonus armor for Thorns damage, health to live long enough for the Thorns to do its job, and MPen to ensure the Thorns isn't blunted by MR. The last of those three is almost impossible for tanks to allocate. When's the last time you saw a Rammus get a Void Staff? You also need your opponent to NOT have high MR or lifesteal, which tends to be wishful thinking. So to put this to discussion, should Thornmail ever be good, or is Thorns itself a toxic mechanic for LoL?",just get morello's too,

"Talk about conflating Intel and x86... Anyways, the reason, as i have come to understand it, for x86 being ""lovely"" to work with from a kernel point of view is PCI. Specifically that the kernel, once the handover from the BIOS is complete, can go out and look up every device on the bus with a vendor specific id code. ARM to a large extent do not have this. The various parts of a SoC just dangle off some opaque data bus, and if you guess wrong you may well trigger some kind of non-recoverable mode via whatever signal you send. BTW, mobile grade Atom have much the same issue. If you follow the link claiming to be about Intel trying to fix things, it actually talks about a Intel reference design. That is not much better than ARM SoCs. Thing about mobile Atom is that to save power, Intel dropped PCI. Anyone remember Moblin? The mobile Linux distro Intel backed for a couple of years before Android got traction? That got started because Microsoft was unable (or reluctant) to supply Windows for a x86 platform without PCI. Heck, even the ARM based Windows RT devices have special SoCs with PCI. There is a PCI equivalent out there, Devicetree, but support is not exactly mandatory... (And now its time for someone to come by and claim i am drop dead wrong)","I remember Moblin, but I think you mean Maemo, or Meego, but maybe you mean Tizen.",

But know this, no one alive is more self critical, self analytical and a harsher reviewer of me than me. It's been a long time since ive ever felt so reflective but in an emotional sport my hearts so invested and I make it my business to teach acceptance honesty and humility. So its in my life blood to look back - we deal with inches, seconds, heart beats and emotion so high I could never put it into words. In 1000's upon 1000's of fights around the globe for more years than most my upmost priority, my heartfelt duty is to protect the fighters whilst never unduly robbing them of the sacrifices they make I've been there on both ends. I love this sport more than I could put into words and. Would never shy away from something that, on any other night I'd have done differently. It breaks my heart to think that a fighter had incurred even one shot they shot they shouldn't have. This is such a world of should, could, would. It's not a game for everyone. It's unique. The need for improvement, growth and acceptance remains continual - and I'll never stop giving these fighters what they truly deserve. Last night presented me with an instance that in truth on any other night on Earth I'm acting sooner - and that's the truth. Thank you all."" Copied from his Facebook page. ""It breaks my heart to think that a fighter had incurred even one shot they shot they shouldn't have"" - That line right there is why he is so respected.

(Full Auto) Scopes: * Reflex Sights * Iron Sights * Ranged Scope Middle Tree: * Hand-Laid Stock * Send It * Field Scout **Exotic Perk: Unstable Coolant** Kills with this gun automatically resets the ammo cooldown; overheating causes lethal damage to user. It also has a void burn on it. The overheat does void damage It's inspired by the covenant plasma guns in Halo and is therefore obviously purple in appearance. The guns exotic perks make it ideal for killing mobs without reloading or waiting for the cooldown but at a range much shorter than Bad JuJu, Fabian Strategy, or Zhalo Supercell.

"Don't want to disclose too much personal info, but I will try and answer your questions. 1. It was a little dizzying, but it was definitely a positive experience. We felt like there was no end in sight to our opportunities, and despite being the world's largest retailer, we still feel that way. I love that our company is so innovative. It keeps the job permanently exciting. 2. Not at all. The top two reasons people sour on working at Amazon are either they didn't expect to work a lot of hours, or they have a bad manager. I am a bit of a workaholic, and I've had almost entirely positive experiences with my superiors. 3. Obviously, any previous sense of intimacy is long gone. We are also no longer the plucky upstart on the way up. When you're top dog, a lot of your focus shifts to external challenges to maintaining that spot. We have to worry about competition from Alibaba. Wal-mart is working to increase their online presence. We have regulatory clashes over things like use of drones, independent contractors, lots of tax law, etc. It's a little less cheery and a bit more wary. However, we also continue to make a point of being innovators, so the Amazon spirit still lives on. 4. It's a weird feeling seeing something that you worked on creating become an everyday thing on such a large scale. Having your work reach hundreds of millions of people can be hard to fully comprehend. Everywhere I travel I meet people using Amazon features that did not exist in the no-so-distant past. It's a crazy experience. 5. Jeff doesn't really have a strong smell. He keeps impeccable personal hygiene--you'll never see an eyelash out of place--and he also doesn't coat himself in cologne or anything.

Despite all the medical research and first-hand accounts of addiction? I mean, just take a look at the neuroscience of addiction, it's not a black box anymore. We know, very well, how the mechanics of addiction work and how physical and psychological addiction works. Bruce Alexander, and by extension, you, are almost certainly wrong in this and the only way you can say you've studied it extensively is by studying things like what Bruce writes and *completely ignoring* the 1,000-fold larger mountain of evidence to the contrary.

"When I was 16 in the mid 90s, aka the ""I know everything, I'm invincible and you can't stop me"" age, I got in a fight with an acquaintance while a whole bunch of us were hanging out at his house. Stupid fight, can't remember what about, but I decided fuck it, I was going home. I lived about 5 miles away, but I didn't have a car, and since it was 2am, there were no buses. I was going to walk home. In the middle of the night, though a not-as-safe-as-it-seem neighborhood, as a tiny 16 year old girl. So I did. I think, in hindsight, my friends either didn't believe I was going to do it, or were too startled by the sudden argument to realize what I was doing. I left the house and started hoofing it. About a mile out, the suburban housing neighborhood melted into a main street, with highway access. I started to notice a greyish minivan following me. It would follow me, pass me, turn a corner, and about 3 blocks later, it would do the same thing. I mean, really really obvious what it was doing. I crossed over to the other side of the street so I was walking the opposite of traffic flow, and thus no car could come up behind me. It kept doing it, on the other side of the street. About a mile later, there was a 24-hour Fred Meyer (west coast USA chain grocery/all-purpose store), lights bright, but parking lot emptyish. I immediately crossed the parking lot and went to head inside. Just before I got to the doors, the minivan that had been following me, pulled up into one of the parking spots. A guy called out from the driver side and said: ""I don't want you to walk over here, just stay there and listen. I just wanted to let you know what I was doing. I saw you walking a while back, but I also saw a dark car that was following you. A couple of times you went to turn around, or stopped, so it started following you down a parallel side street. When I saw it, I started to follow you both, just to make sure you were safe. Go inside the store, and call someone to come pick you up, please. I haven't seen the car since you headed across the lot."" He waited until I was inside the store, and then pulled away. I didn't have anyone to call, so I just let the night cashier know what was going on, and hung out with her for about an hour and a half. Then I finished the walk home. I've never forgotten the incident, or that man, whoever he was. During the walk, I never saw the dark car he mentioned, but I've always been convinced he saved my life that night.","Maybe the van guy is like ""Dexter"" except he uses his rape van to rape other rapists.",

The closest we've come to this was Mia and Deigo's relationship, and Phoenix's past relationship with Dahlia Hawthorne. But no main character has ever had a major love interest. Edgeworth in the DLC case for SOJ said that he never plans on getting married himself, so he gets a pass. But I feel like it's about time for Phoenix or maybe even Apollo to have some sort of love interest. It could provide for some interesting story elements and cases. Why do you think the developers won't introduce any form of love interest for the main cast? Does anyone agree with me that giving Phoenix, Apollo, and/or Athena some sort of love interest would actually be interesting?","Yes, but then they would have to kill him/her because of ""character development""",
